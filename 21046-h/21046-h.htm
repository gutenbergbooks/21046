<h2>PREFACE</h2></div>


<p>This reader undertakes to provide desirable material for work in silent
reading without losing sight of the other elements essential in a good
reader for pupils in the seventh grade or in the first year of the
junior high school.</p>

<p>One task before the teacher of Reading in this year is to foster, by
stimulating material, a taste for good reading which it is to be hoped
has at least been partially formed in the preceding grades. The
selections in this volume are made with the purpose of giving the
seventh-grade pupils such virile and enjoyable literature as will make
them desire more of the same kind. The character and fitness of the
material, not the date of its production, have governed the choice of
the editor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arrangement by Groups.</span> There is an obvious advantage in grouping kindred
reading materials in sections under such captions as "Adventure," "From
Great Books," "Our Country," etc. Besides affording some elements of
continuity, the plan offers opportunity for comparison and contrast of
the treatment of similar themes. It also insures a massing of the effect
of the idea for which the section stands. Secondarily, the section
divisions break up the solid text, and because of this the pupils feel
at frequent intervals that they have completed something definite.</p>

<p>The groupings make no pretense to being mutually exclusive. On occasion
a selection may well be transferred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span> to another section. For example,
the Washington and Lincoln stories should be used in the proper season
in the "Our Country" section although it is obvious that they belong in
"Special Days." Teachers should have no hesitation in breaking across
from one section to another when the occasion or the children's interest
seems to warrant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mechanical Features.</span> Editor and publisher have spared no pains or
expense to make this book attractive to children. The volume is not
cumbersome or unwieldy in size. The length of line is that of the normal
book with which they regularly will come into contact. The type is
clean-cut and legible. Finally, enough white space has been left in the
pages to give the book an "open," attractive appearance. No single item
has so much to do with children's future attitude toward books as the
appearance of their school Readers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Socialized Work.</span> Opportunity for dramatization, committee work, and
other team activity is presented repeatedly throughout this volume.
Wherever the teacher can profitably get the pupils to work in groups she
should take advantage of the cooperative spirit and do so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Citizenship.</span> This means more than the passing phase of so-called
Americanization. It means a genuine love of country, a reverence for our
pioneer fathers, a respect for law, order, and truth. This Reader is
rich in patriotic content. It is hoped that the ethical element in the
selections will be found to be forceful as well as pleasing. The book
emphasizes throughout the importance of the individual and social
virtues. If it can help teachers to make clean, upright, and loyal
citizens of our great Republic it will not have been made in vain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>Mastery of the printed page is not the sole end and aim of Reading. It
is hoped that the devices employed in this Reader, as well as the
direction and suggestions in study materials contained in the volume,
may assist in developing a genuine love of good books.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Manual.</span> Valuable assistance in dealing with the material in this book is
supplied by the <i>Teachers' Manual, Story Hour Readings, Seventh and
Eighth Years</i>. This Manual consists of three parts:</p>

<p>I. An introductory article on the Teaching of Reading, which discusses
Silent Reading (with detailed directions for speed tests), Oral Reading,
Dramatization, Appreciative Reading, Memorizing, Word Study and Use of
the Dictionary, Reading Outside of School, Use of Illustrative Material,
and Correlation.</p>

<p>II. Detailed lesson plans for each selection in <i>Story Hour Readings
Seventh Year</i>.</p>

<p>III. Detailed lesson plans for each selection in <i>Story Hour Readings
Eighth Year</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<h2>ALI HAFED'S QUEST</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Orison Swett Marden</span></h3>



<p>Long, long ago, in the shadowy past, Ali Hafed dwelt<br />
on the shores of the River Indus, in the ancient land of<br />
the Hindus. His beautiful cottage, set in the midst of<br />
fruit and flower gardens, looked from the mountain side<br />
on which it stood over the broad expanse of the noble river.<span class="linenum">5</span><br />
</p><p>Rich meadows, waving fields of grain, and the herds and<br />
flocks contentedly grazing on the pasture lands testified<br />
to the thrift and prosperity of Ali Hafed. The love of<br />
a beautiful wife and a large family of light-hearted boys<br />
and girls made his home an earthly paradise. Healthy,<span class="linenum">10</span><br />
wealthy, contented, rich in love and friendship, his cup of<br />
happiness seemed full to overflowing.</p>
<p>Happy and contented was the good Ali Hafed, when<br />
one evening a learned priest of Buddha, journeying along<br />
the banks of the Indus, stopped for rest and refreshment              <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
at his home, where all wayfarers were hospitably welcomed<br />
and treated as honored guests.<br />
</p><p>
After the evening meal, the farmer and his family with<br />
the priest in their midst gathered around the fireside, the<br />
chilly mountain air of the late autumn making a fire desirable.       <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
The disciple of Buddha entertained his kind hosts<br />
with various legends and myths, and last of all with the<br />
story of the creation.<br />
</p><p>
He told his wondering listeners how in the beginning<br />
the solid earth on which they lived was not solid at all,             <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>but a mere bank of fog. "The Great Spirit," said he,<br />
"thrust his finger into the bank of fog and began slowly<br />
describing a circle in its midst, increasing the speed gradually<br />
until the fog went whirling round his finger so rapidly<br />
that it was transformed into a glowing ball of fire. Then<br />
the Creative Spirit hurled the fiery ball from his hand, and           <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
it shot through the universe, burning its way through other<br />
banks of fog and condensing them into rain, which fell<br />
in great floods, cooling the surface of the immense ball.<br />
</p><p>
"Flames then bursting from the interior through the<br />
cooled outer crust, threw up the hills and mountain ranges            <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
and made the beautiful fertile valleys. In the flood of rain<br />
that followed this fiery upheaval, the substance that<br />
cooled very quickly formed granite, that which cooled<br />
less rapidly became copper, the next in degree cooled down<br />
into silver, and the last became gold. But the most beautiful         <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
substance of all, the diamond, was formed by the first<br />
beams of sunlight condensed on the earth's surface.<br />
</p><p>
"A drop of sunlight the size of my thumb," said the<br />
priest, holding up his hand, "is worth more than mines of<br />
gold. With one such drop," he continued, turning to Ali               <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
Hafed, "you could buy many farms like yours; with a<br />
handful you could buy a province; and with a mine of<br />
diamonds you could purchase a whole kingdom."<br />
</p><p>
The company parted for the night, and Ali Hafed went<br />
to bed, but not to sleep. All night long he tossed restlessly         <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
from side to side, thinking, planning, scheming, how he<br />
could secure some diamonds. The demon of discontent<br />
had entered his soul, and the blessings and advantages<br />
which he possessed in such abundance seemed as by some<br />
malicious magic to have vanished utterly. Although his                <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
wife and children loved him as before&mdash;although his<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>farm, his orchards, his flocks and herds, were as real and<br />
prosperous as they had ever been&mdash;yet the last words of<br />
the priest, which kept ringing in his ears, turned his content<br />
into vague longings and blinded him to all that had hitherto<br />
made him happy.<br />
</p><p>
Before dawn next morning the farmer, full of his purpose,              <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
was astir. Rousing the priest, he eagerly inquired<br />
if he could direct him to a mine of diamonds.<br />
</p><p>
"A mine of diamonds!" echoed the astonished priest.<br />
"What do you, who already have so much to be grateful<br />
for, want with diamonds?"                                             <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
</p><p>
"I wish to be rich and place my children on thrones."<br />
</p><p>
"All you have to do, then," said the Buddhist, "is to<br />
go and search until you find them."<br />
</p><p>
"But where shall I go?" questioned the infatuated man.<br />
</p><p>
"Go anywhere," was the vague reply; "north, south,                    <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
east, or west&mdash;anywhere."<br />
</p><p>
"But how shall I know the place?" asked the farmer.<br />
</p><p>
"When you find a river running over white sands between<br />
high mountain ranges, in these white sands you will find<br />
diamonds. There are many such rivers and many mines                   <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
of diamonds waiting to be discovered. All you have to do<br />
is start out and go somewhere&mdash;" and he waved his hand&mdash;"away,<br />
away!"<br />
</p><p>
Ali Hafed's mind was fully made up. "I will no longer,"<br />
he thought, "remain on a wretched farm, toiling day in and            <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
day out for a mere subsistence, when acres of diamonds&mdash;untold<br />
wealth&mdash;may be had by him who is bold enough<br />
to seek them."<br />
</p><p>
He sold his farm for less than half its value. Then,<br />
after putting his young family under the care of a neighbor,          <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
he set out on his quest&mdash;a quest that was to cover many<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>years and lands.<br />
</p><p>
With high hopes and the coveted diamond mines beckoning<br />
in the far distance, Ali Hafed began his wanderings.<br />
During the first few weeks his spirits did not flag, nor did<br />
his feet grow weary. On and on he tramped, until he<br />
came to the Mountains of the Moon, beyond the bounds                   <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
of Arabia. Weeks stretched into months, and the wanderer<br />
often looked regretfully in the direction of his once-happy<br />
home. Still no gleam of waters glinting over white<br />
sands greeted his eyes. But on he went, into Egypt,<br />
through Palestine and other eastern lands, always looking             <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
for the treasure he still hoped to find.<br />
</p><p>
At last, after years of fruitless search, during which he<br />
had wandered north and south, east and west, hope left<br />
him. All his money was spent. He was starving and<br />
almost naked, and the diamonds&mdash;which had lured him                   <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
away from all that made life dear&mdash;where were they?<br />
Poor Ali Hafed never knew. He died by the wayside,<br />
never dreaming that the wealth for which he had sacrificed<br />
happiness and life might have been his had he remained<br />
at home.                                                              <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>
"Here is a diamond! here is a diamond! Has Ali Hafed<br />
returned?" shouted an excited voice.<br />
</p><p>
The speaker, no other than our old acquaintance, the<br />
Buddhist priest, was standing in the same room where<br />
years before he had told poor Ali Hafed how the world was             <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
made and where diamonds were to be found.<br />
</p><p>
"No, Ali Hafed has not returned," quietly answered his<br />
successor. "Neither is that which you hold in your hand<br />
a diamond. It is but a pretty black pebble I picked up<br />
in my garden."                                                        <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
</p><p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>"I tell you," said the priest excitedly, "this is a genuine<br />
diamond. I know one when I see it. Tell me how and<br />
where you found it."<br />
</p><p>
"One day," replied the farmer slowly, "having led my<br />
camel into the garden to drink, I noticed, as he put his<br />
nose into the water, a sparkle of light coming from the                <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
white sand at the bottom of the clear stream. Stooping<br />
down, I picked up the black pebble you now hold, guided<br />
to it by that crystal eye in the center, from which the light<br />
flashes so brilliantly."<br />
</p><p>
"Why, thou simple one," cried the priest, "this is no                 <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
common stone, but a gem of the purest water. Come,<br />
show me where thou didst find it."<br />
</p><p>
Together they fled to the spot where the farmer had<br />
found the "pebble," and turning over the white sands with<br />
eager fingers, they found, to their great delight, other              <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
stones even more valuable and beautiful than the first.<br />
Then they extended their search, and, so the Oriental<br />
story goes, "every shovelful of the old farm, as acre after<br />
acre was sifted over, revealed gems with which to decorate<br />
the crowns of emperors and moguls."                                   <span class="linenum">20</span><br />

<h2>HOW KILHUGH RODE TO ARTHUR'S HALL</h2>

<h3>By <span class="smcap">James Baldwin</span></h3>


<div class="blockquot"><p>This is a British legend of the days "when good King Arthur ruled the
land." In his castle at Caerleon, according to legend, Arthur had
gathered the most famous of his knights about the Round Table; and
thither every aspiring knight journeyed in quest of adventure.</p></div>


<p>
Prince Kilhugh blushed. The love of Olwen, the<br />
daughter of Thistlehair, filled his heart, although he<br />
had not heard her name before. His face flushed with<br />
happiness, and his eyes shone with joy.<br />
</p><p>
"What is the matter, my son?" asked his father. "Why      <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
are you so gay and glad?"<br />
</p><p>
"Father," answered Kilhugh, "my stepmother says<br />
that no one but Olwen shall be my wife."<br />
</p><p>
"Well," quoth the king, "I doubt not there will be<br />
trouble enough before that saying comes true. But do     <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
not fear, my son. Thou art first cousin to King Arthur.<br />
Who but he should cut thy hair and be thy lord? Go to<br />
him, and crave this of him as a boon."<br />
</p><p>
To Arthur's Hall, therefore, Prince Kilhugh made ready<br />
to go; and his father chose fifty of his bravest knights <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
to go with him, that he might present himself to King<br />
Arthur in a befitting manner.<br />
</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>
So gayly the youth rode forth upon a steed of dappled<br />
gray, four summers old, with shell-shaped hoofs and well-knit<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>limbs. His saddle was of burnished gold, his bridle      <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
of shining gold chains. His saddle cloth was of purple<br />
silk, with four golden apples embroidered in the four<br />
corners.<br />
</p><p>
The war horn slung over his shoulder was of ivory; the<br />
sword that hung by his side had a golden hilt and a two-edged          <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
blade inlaid with a cross of gold that glittered like<br />
the lightning of heaven. His shoes, from the knee to the<br />
tip of the toe, were embossed with gold worth three hundred<br />
cattle; and his stirrups also were of gold.<br />
</p><p>
In his hand he held two spears, with shafts of silver and<span class="linenum">10</span><br />
heads of tempered steel, and of an edge so sharp as to wound<br />
the wind and cause the blood to flow. Two white-breasted<br />
greyhounds bounded before his steed. Broad collars<br />
set with rubies were on their necks; and to and fro they <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
sprang, like two sea swallows sporting around him. The<br />
blades of reed grass bent not beneath him, so light was<br />
his courser's tread, as he journeyed toward the gate of<br />
Arthur's palace.<br />
</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>
The Wide White Hall of Arthur had been built by Rearfort,<span class="linenum">20</span><br />
the architect. Eight and forty were the rafters of<br />
its roof. It would hold all Arthur's companions and his<br />
nobles, his warriors, his retainers, and his guests.<br />
</p><p>
While Kilhugh was riding thither, the tables were set<br />
for the evening meal. The king, with his knights, his<br />
friends, and his attendants, were in their places around <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
the board. And the gate of the outer court was locked.<br />
</p><p>
As the prince rode on, he beheld from afar the walls and<br />
towers of Arthur's Hall. When he drew rein within the<br />
shadow of the vast portal, he saw that the door was closed<br />
and barred, and an armed warrior, stalwart and strong,   <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>was standing before it.<br />
</p><p>
"O chieftain," he said, "is it King Arthur's custom<br />
to have a gatekeeper stationed here?"<br />
</p><p>
"It is," replied the warrior sternly; "and if thou dost<br />
not hold thy peace, scant shall be thy welcome. I am<br />
Arthur's porter every New Year's Day, and that is why I   <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
am here now."<br />
</p><p>
"And who is the porter at other times?" asked Prince<br />
Kilhugh.<br />
</p><p>
"At other times the gate is guarded by four lusty chieftains<br />
who serve under me," answered the Dusky Hero with        <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
the Mighty Grasp. "The names of the first two are<br />
Blandmien and Speedguest. The third is Grumgruff, a<br />
man who never did anyone a favor in his life. The fourth<br />
is Rumbleroll, who goes on his head to save his feet. He<br />
neither holds it up to the sky like a man, nor stretches it           <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
out toward the ground like a brute; but he goes tumbling<br />
about the floor, like nothing but a rolling stone."<br />
</p><p>
"Unbar the door and let me in," commanded Kilhugh.<br />
</p><p>
"Nay, that I will not," answered the Dusky Hero with<br />
the Mighty Grasp.                                        <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
</p><p>
"And why not?" cried the prince.<br />
</p><p>
"The knife is in the meat and the drink is in the horn,<br />
and there is revelry in Arthur's Hall; and no man may<br />
enter in save the son of a king from a friendly land. But<br />
never shall it be said that a wayfarer was turned harshly<span class="linenum">25</span><br />
away from Arthur's door. Food enough for thee and thy<br />
fifty men shall be prepared; collops shall be cooked and<br />
peppered for all. In the stables there is fodder for thy<br />
horses and food in plenty for thy dogs. And thou shalt<br />
fare as well in the guest chamber as in the hall; only be<span class="linenum">30</span><br />
content, and disturb not the king and his knights at the<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>table."<br />
</p><p>
"Nay, I will have nothing of all this," said young Kilhugh.<br />
"If thou wilt open the door, well and good. But<br />
if not, I will bring dishonor upon Arthur and shame upon<br />
thee. Here, on the spot where I stand, I will shout thrice<br />
and make the welkin ring. Sounds more deadly than         <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
those three shouts have never been heard in this land.<br />
They shall resound from Land's End to Cold Blast Ridge<br />
in Ireland, and turn the hearts of youths and maidens<br />
cold as stone. Matrons shall grow wan and weakly and<br />
many a mother's child shall die of fright&mdash;so dreadful   <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
will be my voice."<br />
</p><p>
The Dusky Hero with the Mighty Grasp stood firm,<br />
although his heart misgave him. "No clamor that thou<br />
canst make," said he, "will ever admit thee here against<br />
King Arthur's wishes. However, I will go and tell him    <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
thou art here."<br />
</p><p>
Well might he be perturbed by Kilhugh's threat. For<br />
he remembered what had once happened in the days of<br />
King Lud, when all Britain had been shaken by a fearful<br />
shriek. At the sound of it, men had grown pale and feeble,           <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
women listless and sad, and youths and maidens forlorn<br />
and woebegone. Beasts deserted their young ones, birds<br />
left their nestlings, trees cast off their fruit, the earth<br />
yielded no harvest.<br />
</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>
Pondering upon these things, the Dusky Hero with the     <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
Mighty Grasp strode into the hall. King Arthur saw him<br />
and called out, "Hast thou come with tidings from the<br />
door?"<br />
</p><p>
The Dusky Hero bowed, and answered in stately phrase,<br />
becoming a knight of the Table Round:                    <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
</p><p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>"Half of my life is past, noble king, and half of thine.<br />
I have been with thee in Europe, in Asia, in Africa, and in<br />
the Island of Corsica. I was thy companion when thou<br />
didst spread the terror of the sword from Scandinavia to<br />
Spain. I fought by thy side in the Battle of Shades, when<br />
we brought away twelve hostages from the Dim Land under   <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
the Sea. I have been in Jerusalem and in Castle Covert-and-Clearing,<br />
built all of dead men's bones. I have been<br />
in Turning Castle, and in the Castle of Riches; and there<br />
thou knowest we saw nine kings of nations, all comely men<br />
of noble mien. Yet, I protest and declare that I never   <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
before saw a youth so handsome and dignified as that one<br />
who is now sitting astride his horse and waiting outside<br />
the door of this hall."<br />
</p><p>
Then cried the king, "Thou didst walk hither to tell me<br />
of him; now hie thee back to him, running at full speed. <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
Invite him to come in; and let every man who sees the light,<br />
and every man who blinks the eye, stand ready to do him<br />
honor."<br />
</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>
The Dusky Hero with the Mighty Grasp returned to<br />
the great door. He drew back bolt and bar, and set it    <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
wide open before the prince and his train. The men at<br />
arms dismounted at the horse block in the courtyard, but<br />
Kilhugh still sat upon his steed and rode into the Hall.<br />
</p><p>
"Hail to thee, King Arthur!" he cried. "I greet thee<br />
and thy guests and thy companions and thy warriors.      <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
My greeting is to the lowest as well as to the highest of all<br />
that have a seat within this Hall. May thy name, King<br />
Arthur, and thy fame and thy renown be forever held in<br />
glorious memory throughout the length and the breadth<br />
of this land!"                                           <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
</p><p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>"Hail to thee, noble youth!" returned Arthur. "Thou<br />
art right welcome. Here is a place for thee between two of<br />
my knights. Sit down, and my minstrels will play for thee."<br />
</p><p>
But Kilhugh made answer: "I have not come hither,<br />
sire, to eat and drink, but to crave of thee a boon. If thou<br />
wilt grant it me, I will do thee such service as thou mayest          <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
command; and I will carry the praise of thy bounty and<br />
thy power into every land. But if thou dost refuse, I will<br />
spread ill reports of thee to the four quarters of the world."<br />
</p><p>
Then King Arthur was greatly pleased, and he said:<br />
"Ask thy boon, young chieftain. Thou shalt have whatever <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
thy tongue may name, as far as the wind dries and the<br />
rain moistens and the sun revolves and the sea encircles<br />
and the earth extends. Thou shalt have anything that is<br />
mine, except my ship that bears me over the sea, and<br />
the mantle in which I can walk unseen, and my good sword,<span class="linenum">15</span><br />
and my keen lance, and my shield, and my gleaming dagger,<br />
and Guinevere my wife. Ask what thou wilt."<br />
</p><p>
"My request is, that thou wilt cut my hair," answered<br />
Kilhugh.<br />
</p><p>
"Thy request is granted," quoth the king.<span class="linenum">20</span><br />
</p><p>
Then Arthur called for a golden comb and a pair of<br />
scissors with silver loops. And he combed the hair of the<br />
prince, as he sat upon his steed, and cut it front and back.<br />
</p><p>
"Now tell me thy name," he said.<br />
</p><p>
"My name is Kilhugh," replied the prince. "My father     <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
is Prince Kilith, and my mother was a sister of the fair<br />
Ygerne."<br />
</p><p>
"Then we are cousins," cried Arthur, "and I give thee<br />
leave to ask another boon. Ask what thou wilt."<br />
"Promise me, for the honor of thy kingdom, to grant      <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
my boon," said Kilhugh.<br />
</p><p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>"I promise."<br />
</p><p>
"Then do I crave of thee to obtain for me Olwen, the<br />
daughter of Thistlehair, chief of the Giants, to be my wife. . . .<br />
For the sake of the daughters of the Island of the<br />
Mighty, I crave thy help to seek this maiden. For the<br />
sake of Guinevere and of her sister; for the sake of Lynette           <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
of the Magic Ring; for the sake of Cordelia the daughter<br />
of King Lear, the loveliest maiden in this island; and for<br />
the sake of Iseult la Belle, and of Elaine, and of Angarad<br />
of the Golden Hand&mdash;for the sake of these and many<br />
others, I crave thy help."                               <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
</p><p>
Then said Arthur, "O prince and cousin, I have never<br />
heard of this maiden, Olwen; I have never heard of her<br />
kindred. But I will send messengers to seek her; only<br />
grant them time to find her and return."<br />
</p><p>
"To-day is New Year's Day," answered the prince.         <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
"I give them from this hour till the last day of the year."<br />
</p><p>
And having said these words, he dismounted from his<br />
steed and went and sat by King Arthur's side in the midst<br />
of the heroes of the Table Round.<br />

<h2>THE GIFT OF THE WHITE BEAR</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By George Webbe Dasent</span></h3>



<p>
A long time ago there lived in Iceland a man whose<br />
name was Audun. His means were small, but everybody<br />
knew of his goodness. In order to see the world and to<br />
add to his wealth, he once sailed to Greenland with a sea<br />
captain named Thorir. Before he went, he gave everything  <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
that he had to his mother&mdash;and this was not much.<br />
</p><p>
In Greenland Audun bought a white bear that was well<br />
tamed and trained&mdash;and it was the greatest treasure of<br />
a bear that had ever been thought of. The next summer<br />
Thorir sailed back to Norway, and Audun went with him,   <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
taking the bear.<br />
</p><p>
Now Audun had made up his mind to give the bear to<br />
Sweyn, the king of Denmark; and so, leaving Thorir, he<br />
made his way south to the Cattegat. While he was waiting<br />
for some vessel that would carry him across the channel, it           <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
so happened that Harold, the king of Norway, came also to<br />
the same place.<br />
</p><p>
Of course some one soon told King Harold about the<br />
Icelander who had lately come from Greenland with a<br />
wonderful white bear, and he at once sent for Audun.     <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
</p><p>
"I have heard about your white bear," said Harold,<br />
"and I wish to buy it."<br />
</p><p>
"I will not sell it," answered Audun.<br />
</p><p>
"But I will pay you twice as much as you gave for it,"<br />
said the king.                                           <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
</p><p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>"Not for any price will I sell it," said the Icelander.<br />
</p><p>
"Then will you give it to me?" asked the king.<br />
</p><p>
"No, my lord, I will not do that," answered Audun.<br />
</p><p>
"What, then, will you do with it?" asked the king.<br />
</p><p>
Audun answered, "I have made up my mind to take it<br />
to Denmark and give it to King Sweyn, for he is also the  <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
king of my own country."<br />
</p><p>
Then Harold spoke up sharply: "Don't you know, my<br />
fellow, that there is war between Norway and Denmark,<br />
and between myself and your King Sweyn? Don't you<br />
know that I have the power to prevent you from ever      <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
getting to his land?"<br />
</p><p>
Audun answered, "I know that you have the power, and<br />
that all rests with you. But I will consent to nothing<br />
save to do as I have told you."<br />
</p><p>
The king sat in thought for a moment and then said,      <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
"Well, I see no reason why you should not do as you please<br />
in this matter. But promise me that when you come this<br />
way again, you will tell me how King Sweyn rewarded you<br />
for the beast."<br />
</p><p>
"I give you my word to do that," answered Audun.         <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
</p><p>
Then, leading the bear behind him, he went away. But<br />
it was a long time before he could find any means to cross<br />
over into Denmark, and when at last he set foot upon the<br />
shores of that country he had not even a penny with which<br />
to buy food. Both he and the bear were starving, and it  <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
was a long way to the place where the king was staying.<br />
</p><p>
In his distress, Audun went to a rich man named Auki<br />
and begged for food for himself and his bear.<br />
</p><p>
"What are you going to do with the beast?" asked<br />
Auki.                                                    <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
</p><p>
"Give him to King Sweyn," answered the Icelander.<br />
</p><p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>"And how much do you expect to receive for him?"<br />
</p><p>
"Only so much as the king in his bounty wishes to give."<br />
</p><p>
Then the rich man answered, "If you will give me one<br />
half of the bear, I will feed you both."<br />
</p><p>
And to this Audun made agreement, for he was almost<br />
dead of hunger and so was the bear.                       <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
</p><p>
Then the Icelander and the rich man went on, leading<br />
the bear, until they came to King Sweyn's house. The<br />
king greeted Auki in a friendly manner, and turning to<br />
Audun, said, "You are a stranger to me. Pray tell me<br />
whence you have come."                                   <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
</p><p>
"I am from Iceland," answered Audun, "and have but<br />
lately been to Greenland. My errand here is to give you<br />
a white bear which I bought in Greenland. But my<br />
necessities have obliged me to part with one half of the<br />
beast, and I can only beg of you to accept the other half."           <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
And then, after much questioning, he told the whole story.<br />
</p><p>
The king turned to the rich man, who was standing by,<br />
and asked, "Is this true, Auki?"<br />
</p><p>
"It is, my lord," answered Auki.<br />
</p><p>
Then the king was angry and sent the rich man home,      <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
empty-handed and sorrowful. But he said to the Icelander,<br />
"I thank you for the rare and wonderful gift which you<br />
have brought me. Stay here in my house for a while."<br />
</p><p>
So Audun dwelt for some time with the king's household,<br />
and no man was more faithful, more honest, or more       <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
brave than he. Many deeds of courage did he perform,<br />
and many and worthy were his services. All men liked<br />
him, and the king was most gracious to him; but his heart<br />
turned always toward Iceland and his poor mother whom<br />
he had left behind.                                      <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
</p><p>
One day when the springtide was drawing on, the king<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>spoke to the Icelander and said: "Audun, I have never<br />
yet given you anything for the white bear. I have a mind<br />
to make you one of my chief officers, so that you shall<br />
always be near me."<br />
</p><p>
And Audun answered, "I thank you, my lord, with all<br />
my heart. But far away over the northern seas there is a  <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
poor woman who is my mother. I fear that by this time<br />
she is in want; for although I left her all that I had, it<br />
was not much. I cannot bear to sit here in ease and honor<br />
while she has not enough to keep hunger away. And so I<br />
have set my heart on sailing for Iceland."               <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
</p><p>
"There speaks a good man and true," cried the king.<br />
"You shall do as you most desire; but wait a little while<br />
till a ship is ready."<br />
</p><p>
So Audun waited. And one day when spring was at its<br />
best, King Sweyn went with him down to the waterside,    <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
where many men were busy freighting ships for foreign<br />
lands. They walked till they came to a merchant vessel<br />
of fine size.<br />
</p><p>
"What do you think of this ship, Audun?" asked the<br />
king.                                                    <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
</p><p>
"She is fine enough, surely," answered the Icelander.<br />
</p><p>
"Well," said the king, "I will now repay you for the<br />
bear. This ship and all the goods on board of it are<br />
yours."<br />
</p><p>
Audun thanked the king as well as he could. And when     <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
the day came for the ship to sail, the two walked down to<br />
the waterside again.<br />
</p><p>
"I have heard much of the perils of the sea," said King<br />
Sweyn, "and if this fair ship should be wrecked, all your<br />
goods will doubtless be lost and little will be left to show          <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
that you have met the king of Denmark."<br />
</p><p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>As he said this, the king put into Audun's hand a<br />
leather bag, full of silver, saying, "Take this, and even if<br />
your ship goes down, you will not be entirely penniless."<br />
</p><p>
Audun was so filled with gratitude that he could not<br />
speak. But the king had still another surprise for him.<br />
He drew a ring of gold, very costly, from his arm and put <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
it upon the arm of the Icelander.<br />
</p><p>
"Take this," he said. "Even though you should lose<br />
ship and goods and money, you will still not be penniless,<br />
for the gold will be around your arm."<br />
</p><p>
What could Audun do? What could he say?                  <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
</p><p>
The king shook his hand at parting, and said: "I have<br />
this to ask of you: Keep the gold ring on your arm and<br />
do not part with it on any account, unless it be to some<br />
great man to whom you feel yourself bound to give your<br />
best treasure in return for a great favor and much goodness.          <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
And now, farewell, and may good luck follow your voyage."<br />
</p><p>
Then Audun, in his fair, rich ship, put to sea.<br />
</p><p>
On his way to Iceland he stopped for a time in a haven<br />
of Norway, where he heard that King Harold was holding<br />
his court. He was desirous of seeing the king, as he had <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
given his word.<br />
</p><p>
King Harold remembered him well and received him<br />
kindly.<br />
</p><p>
"Sit here and tell me how it fared with you in Denmark,"<br />
he said.                                                 <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
</p><p>
Audun told him a part of his story.<br />
</p><p>
"But how did King Sweyn repay you for the white bear?"<br />
asked Harold.<br />
</p><p>
"In this wise, my lord," answered Audun: "He took it<br />
and thanked me when I offered it."                       <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
</p><p>
"I would have repaid you as well myself," said Harold,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>"What more did he give you?"<br />
</p><p>
"He asked me to abide in his house, and he gave me his<br />
friendship. He offered me still greater honor if I would<br />
stay longer with him."<br />
</p><p>
"That was good; but I would have done as much.<br />
He must have given you something more."                   <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
</p><p>
"Yes. He gave me a merchant ship filled with rich<br />
goods for trade in northern ports."<br />
</p><p>
"That was a noble gift," said the king; "but I would<br />
have equaled it. Did he give you anything more?"<br />
</p><p>
Audun answered, "Yes, he gave me a leather bag full of   <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
silver; for he said that if the ship and her cargo should be<br />
lost in the sea, yet would I not go penniless."<br />
</p><p>
"That was nobly thought of," said Harold; "and it is<br />
more than I would have done. But what else did he give?"<br />
</p><p>
Then Audun took the gold ring from his arm and put       <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
it upon King Harold's arm, saying, "He gave me as a farewell<br />
gift this priceless ring; and he bade me never to part<br />
with it save to some great man to whom I felt myself indebted<br />
for his goodness. And now I have found that man.<br />
For it was in your power to take away not only the bear  <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
but my life also, and yet you allowed me to go in peace to<br />
Denmark."<br />
</p><p>
The king looked at the ring and then at the man; for<br />
both were of very great worth. "I thank you, Audun," he<br />
said; and they had much pleasant talk before they parted.<span class="linenum">25</span><br />
</p><p>
And when Audun at length came with his ship to Iceland,<br />
everybody welcomed him as the luckiest man in the world; and<br />
he made his poor mother comfortable for the rest of her life.<br />

<h2>THE STORY OF IRON</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This is one of the tales from the <i>Kalevala</i> ("Home of the Heroes"), a
group of legends from Finland. These tales were sung in verse very
similar to that which Longfellow used in <i>Hiawatha</i>. The following is a
prose translation of one of the popular myths.</p></div>


<p>
The first of all mothers was Air, and she had three<br />
daughters. Of these three maidens there is much<br />
to be said. They were as lovely as the rainbow after a<br />
storm; they were as fair as the full moon shining above<br />
the mountains. They walked with noiseless feet among      <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
the clouds and showered gifts upon the earth. They sent<br />
the refreshing rain, the silent dew, and the nipping frost,<br />
each in its season. They gave life to the fields, and strength<br />
to the mountains, and grandeur to the sea. And because<br />
of their bounty the earth was glad and the stars twinkled<span class="linenum">10</span><br />
for joy.<br />
</p><p>
"What more can we do to make the land fit for men to<br />
dwell in? What other gift have we to bestow?" asked the<br />
eldest of the sisters.<br />
</p><p>
And the youngest said, "Let us send down iron&mdash;iron      <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
of which tools may be made, iron of which sharp weapons<br />
may be shaped. For without tools man will not be able<br />
to plow, to reap, or to build; and without weapons he<br />
cannot defend himself against the savage beasts of the<br />
forest."                                                 <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
</p><p>
So when the sun was about going down, the sisters<br />
went forth in trailing robes of purple and crimson and gold;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>and in their hands they bore mighty vessels of foaming milk.<br />
The eldest sprinkled red milk in the brooks and marshes<br />
and along the banks of the rivers. The middle one scattered<br />
white milk on the wooded hills and the stony mountains.<br />
The youngest showered blue milk in the valleys<br />
and by the gray seashore. And, on the morrow, where       <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
the red milk had been sprinkled, red and brittle ore of<br />
iron flecked the ground; where the white milk had been<br />
scattered, powdery ore of a yellow hue abounded; and<br />
where the blue milk had been showered, flaky masses of<br />
crude iron, tough and dark, lay hidden beneath the soil. <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
</p><p>
Thus came Iron into the world&mdash;Iron, the youngest<br />
of three brothers. Next older than he was Fire, a raging,<br />
dangerous fellow when free, but loving and faithful when<br />
held in bonds. Older still was Water, terrible in strength<br />
but, when not aroused, as gentle as a mother's caress.   <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
</p><p>
Years upon years went by, and at length one day Iron<br />
set out to visit his brothers. He found Water at home in<br />
the deep sea, and by him he was welcomed kindly enough.<br />
But when he climbed a mountain to see his second brother<br />
he had quite another reception. Fire was in a raging     <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
mood. The terrible fellow leaped and roared and stretched<br />
out his long red fingers as though he would devour his<br />
visitor.<br />
</p><p>
Iron was so terrified that he turned and fled down the<br />
steep slopes, never stopping nor pausing to look behind. <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
He ran on, hiding in clefts and chasms, creeping under<br />
rocks, and lurking in the dry beds of mountain torrents.<br />
When by and by he reached the level plain, he glanced<br />
backward. The hills and the whole mountain top were<br />
aflame.                                                  <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
</p><p>
Wild with terror he hurried on, hiding himself in the<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>woods and under the roots of trees and resting at last in<br />
reedy marshes where swans build their nests and wild geese<br />
rear their young.<br />
</p><p>
For ages and ages&mdash;nobody knows how many&mdash;Iron<br />
lay hidden in bogs and forests and lonely caverns. Fear<br />
of his raging brother made him lurk in lonely places, made<span class="linenum">5</span><br />
him cover up his face. Lazy bears went ambling through<br />
the rocky places; wolves rushed madly over the oozy<br />
marshlands; and timid deer ran and leaped among the<br />
trees. In time the hiding places of Iron were uncovered.<br />
Where the paws of bears had plodded often, where the feet<span class="linenum">10</span><br />
of wolves had pattered, where the sharp hoofs of deer had<br />
trodden, there the timid metal, red, gray, yellow, black,<br />
peeped shyly out.<br />
</p><p>
At length into that same land there came a skillful Smith.<br />
He carried a hammer of stone in one hand and tongs of    <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
bronze in the other, and a song of peace was upon his lips.<br />
On a green hillock, where the south wind blew, he built<br />
him a smithy, and in it he placed the tools of his craft.<br />
His anvil was a block of gray granite; his forge was carefully<br />
built of sand and clay; his bellows was made of the      <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
skins of mountain goats sewn together.<br />
</p><p>
The Smith heaped live coals in his forge and blew with<br />
his bellows until the flames leaped up, roaring and sparkling,<br />
and the smoke rose in dense clouds over the roof of the<br />
smithy. "This forge will do its work well," he said. Then<span class="linenum">25</span><br />
he checked the bellows and smothered the flames and raked<br />
ashes upon the fire until the red coals slumbered unseen at<br />
the mouth of the forge.<br />
</p><p>
Out into the forest the Smith wandered. Closely he<br />
scanned the hillsides and the boggy thickets and the paths            <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
among the trees. And there, where the bears had trailed<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>and the wolves had rushed and the deer had left their<br />
footprints, he found ruddy Iron, dusky Iron, yellow ore<br />
of Iron, peeping, trembling, hiding. The heart of the<br />
Smith was glad. His eyes danced merrily, and he sang a<br />
song of magic to the timid metal:<br />
</p>

<div>
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">"Iron, Iron, hearken while I call you</span><span class="linenum">5</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">Let no false and foolish fears appal you,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">Come from out the crevices that hide you,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">Leave the worthless stones that are beside you,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">Leave the earth that lies around, above you,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">And come with me, for I do dearly love you."</span><span class="linenum">10</span><br />
</div>

<p>
Iron moved not, but timidly answered, "I dare not<br />
leave my hiding places; for Fire, my brother, waits to<br />
devour me. He is strong and fierce. He has no pity."<br />
</p><p>
The Smith shook his head and made reply, still singing:<br />
</p>

<div>
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">"No! your brother does not wish to harm you&mdash;</span><span class="linenum">15</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">Willingly he never would alarm you.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">With his glowing arms he would caress you,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">Make you pure and with his kisses bless you.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">So come with me, my smithy waits to greet you;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">In my forge your brother waits to meet you&mdash;</span><span class="linenum">20</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">Waits to throw his loving arms around you,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">Glad indeed that thus, at last, he's found you."</span><br />
</div>
<p>
These words made Iron feel much braver; and they<br />
were spoken in tones so sweet and persuasive that he was<br />
almost minded to obey without another word. But he asked,<span class="linenum">25</span><br />
"Why should I leave these places where I have rested so<br />
long? What will become of me after I have made friends<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>with Fire?"<br />
</p><p>
Again the Smith replied to the query of Iron in a magic<br />
song:<br />
</p>


<div>
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">"Come with me, for kindly we will treat you.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">On my anvil gently will I beat you;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">With my tongs, then, deftly will I hold you;</span> <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">With my hammer I will shape and mold you</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">Into forms so fair that all will prize you,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">Forms so rare that none will e'er despise you:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">Axes, knives (so men will wish to use you),</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">Needles, pins (so women, too, will choose you).</span> <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">Come with me, your brother will not harm you,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">Come with me, my smithy sure will charm you."</span><br />
</div>

<p>
Hearing this, Iron came out of his lurking places and<br />
without more ado bashfully followed the cunning Smith.<br />
But no sooner was he in the smithy than he felt himself<span class="linenum">15</span><br />
a prisoner. The tongs of bronze gripped him and thrust<br />
him into the forge. The bellows roared, the Smith shouted,<br />
and Fire leaped joyfully out of the ashes and threw his<br />
arms around his helpless younger brother. And bashful,<br />
bashful Iron turned first red and then white and finally<span class="linenum">20</span><br />
became as soft as dough and as radiant as the sun.<br />
</p><p>
Then the tongs of bronze drew him forth from the flames,<br />
and twirled him in the air, and threw him upon the anvil;<br />
and the hammer of stone beat him fiercely again and again<br />
until he shrieked with pain.<span class="linenum">25</span>
</p><p>
"Oh, spare me! spare me!" he cried. "Do not deal so<br />
roughly with me. Let me go back to my lonely hiding<br />
places and lie there in peace as in the days of old."<br />
</p><p>
But the tongs pinched him worse than before, and the<br />
hammer beat him still harder, and the Smith answered: <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
</p><p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>"Not so, not so! Be not so cowardly. We do not hurt<br />
you; you are only frightened. Be brave and I will shape<br />
you into things of great use to men. Be brave and you<br />
shall rule the world."<br />
</p><p>
Then in spite of Iron's piteous cries, he kept on pounding<br />
and twisting and turning and shaping the helpless metal   <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
until at length it was changed into many forms of use and<br />
beauty&mdash;rings, chains, axes, knives, cups, and curious<br />
tools. But it was so soft, after being thus heated and<br />
beaten, that the edges of the tools were quickly dulled.<br />
Try as he might, the Smith did not know how to give the  <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
metal a harder temper.<br />
</p><p>
One day a honeybee strolled that way. It buzzed<br />
around the smithy and then lit on a clover blossom by the<br />
door.<br />
</p><p>
"O bee," cried the busy Smith, "you are a cunning        <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
little bird, and you know some things better than I know<br />
them. Come now, and help me temper this soft metal.<br />
Bring me a drop of your honey; bring the sweet liquor<br />
which you suck from the meadow flower; bring the magic<br />
dew of the wildwood. Give me all such things that I may  <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
make a mixture to harden Iron."<br />
</p><p>
The bee answered not&mdash;it was too busy with its own<br />
affairs. It gathered what honey it could from the blossom<br />
and then flew swiftly away.<br />
</p><p>
Under the eaves above the smithy door an idler was       <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
sitting&mdash;a mischief-making hornet who heard every word<br />
that the Smith said.<br />
</p><p>
"I will help him make a mixture," this wicked insect<br />
muttered. "I will help him to give Iron another temper."<br />
</p><p>
Forthwith he flew to the thorny thickets and the miry    <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
bogs and the fever-breeding marshes, to gather what evils<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>he might. Soon he returned with an arm load&mdash;the poison<br />
of spiders, the venom of serpents, the miasmata of swamps,<br />
the juice of the deadly nightshade. All these he cast into<br />
the tub of water wherein the Smith was vainly trying to<br />
temper Iron.<br />
</p><p>
The Smith did not see him, but he heard him buzzing       <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
and supposed it was the honeybee with sweets from the<br />
meadow flowers.<br />
</p><p>
"Thank you, pretty little bird," he said. "Now I hope<br />
we shall have a better metal. I hope we shall make edges<br />
that will cut and not be dulled so easily."              <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
</p><p>
Thereupon he drew a bar of the metal, white hot, from<br />
the forge. He held it, hissing and screeching, under the<br />
water into which the poisons had been poured. Little<br />
thought he of the evil that was there. He heard the hornet<br />
humming and laughing under the eaves.                    <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
</p><p>
"Tiny honeybee," he said, "you have brought me much<br />
sweetness. Iron tempered with your honey will be sweet<br />
although sharp. Nothing shall be wrought of it that is<br />
not beautiful and helpful and kind."<br />
</p><p>
He drew the metal from the tub. He thrust it back        <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
among the red coals. He plied the bellows and the flames<br />
leaped up. Then, when the metal was glowing again, he<br />
laid it on the anvil and beat it with strong, swift strokes;<br />
and as he worked he sang:<br />
</p>

<div>
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">"Ding! Ding! Ding-a-ling, ding!</span><span class="linenum">25</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">Of Iron, sharp Iron, strong Iron, I sing,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">Of Iron my servant, of Iron my king&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">Ding! Ding-a-ling, ding!"</span><br />
</div>

<p>
Forthwith Iron leaped up, angry and biting and fierce.<br />
He was not a soft and ductile metal as before, but Iron  <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>hardened into tough blue steel. Showers of sparks flew<br />
from him, snapping, burning, threatening; and from among<br />
them sprang swords and spears and battle-axes, and daggers<br />
keen and pointed. Out of the smithy and out through<br />
the great world these cruel weapons raced, slashing and<br />
clashing, thrusting and cutting, raging and killing, and  <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
carrying madness among men.<br />
</p><p>
The wicked hornet, idling under the eaves, rejoiced at<br />
the mischief he had wrought. But the Smith was filled<br />
with grief, and the music of his anvil became a jangling<br />
discord.                                                 <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
</p><p>
"Oh, Iron," he cried, "it was not for this that I caused<br />
you to leave your hiding places in the hills and bogs! The<br />
three sisters intended that you should be a blessing to<br />
mankind; but now I greatly fear that you will become a<br />
curse."                                                  <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
</p><p>
At that moment the honeybee, laden with the sweets of<br />
field and wood, came buzzing into the smithy. It whispered<br />
hopefully into the ear of the Smith: "Wait until<br />
my gifts have done their work."<br />

<h2>THE WONDERFUL ARTISAN</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By James Baldwin</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>There are enough Greek legends to fill several volumes. They relate the
doings of the gods and heroes of ancient Greece, and endeavor to account
for the origin of plants and animals and the founding of cities. This
story no doubt contains many facts but it is chiefly fiction.</p></div>

<p>
While Athens was still only a small city there lived<br />
within its walls a man named D&aelig;dalus (d&#277;d&acute;a-l&#365;s),<br />
who was the most skillful worker in wood and stone and<br />
metal that had ever been known. It was he who taught<br />
the people how to build better houses and how to hang     <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
their doors on hinges and how to support the roofs with<br />
pillars and posts. He was the first to fasten things together<br />
with glue; he invented the plumb line and the<br />
auger; and he showed seamen how to put up masts in their<br />
ships and how to rig the sails to them with ropes. He    <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
built a stone palace for &AElig;geus, the young king of Athens,<br />
and beautified the Temple of Athena which stood on the<br />
great rocky hill in the middle of the city.<br />
</p><p>
D&aelig;dalus had a nephew named Perdix, whom he had<br />
taken when a boy to teach the trade of builder. But      <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
Perdix was a very apt learner and soon surpassed his master<br />
in the knowledge of many things. His eyes were ever<br />
open to see what was going on about him, and he learned<br />
the lore of the fields and the woods. Walking one day by<br />
the sea he picked up the backbone of a great fish, and from           <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
it he invented the saw. Seeing how a certain bird carved<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>holes in the trunks of trees, he learned how to make and use<br />
the chisel. Then he invented the wheel which potters<br />
use in molding clay; and he made of a forked stick the<br />
first pair of compasses for drawing circles; and he studied<br />
out many other curious and useful things.<br />
</p><p>
D&aelig;dalus was not pleased when he saw that the lad was      <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
so apt and wise, so ready to learn, and so eager to do.<br />
</p><p>
"If he keeps on in this way," he murmured, "he will<br />
be a greater man than I; his name will be remembered<br />
and mine will be forgotten."<br />
</p><p>
Day after day, while at his work, D&aelig;dalus pondered over  <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
this matter, and soon his heart was filled with hatred<br />
towards young Perdix. One morning when the two were<br />
putting up an ornament on the outer wall of Athena's<br />
temple, D&aelig;dalus bade his nephew go out on a narrow<br />
scaffold which hung high over the edge of the rocky cliff<span class="linenum">15</span><br />
whereon the temple stood. Then when the lad obeyed,<br />
it was easy enough, with a blow of a hammer, to knock<br />
the scaffold from its fastenings.<br />
</p><p>
Poor Perdix fell headlong through the air, and he would<br />
have been dashed in pieces upon the stones at the foot of<span class="linenum">20</span><br />
the cliff had not kind Athena seen him and taken pity<br />
upon him. While he was yet whirling through mid-air<br />
she changed him into a partridge, and he flitted away to<br />
the hills to live forever in the woods and fields which he<br />
loved so well. And to this day, when summer breezes      <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
blow and the wild flowers bloom in meadow and glade,<br />
the voice of Perdix may still sometimes be heard calling<br />
to his mate from among the grass and reeds or amid the<br />
leafy underwoods.<br />
</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>
As for D&aelig;dalus, when the people of Athens heard of his   <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>dastardly deed they were filled with grief and rage&mdash;grief<br />
for young Perdix, whom all had learned to love; rage<br />
towards the wicked uncle who loved only himself. At first<br />
they were for punishing D&aelig;dalus with the death which<br />
he so richly deserved, but when they remembered what he<br />
had done to make their homes pleasanter and their lives   <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
easier they allowed him to live; and yet they drove him<br />
out of Athens and bade him never return.<br />
</p><p>
There was a ship in the harbor just ready to start on a<br />
voyage across the sea, and in it D&aelig;dalus embarked with<br />
all his precious tools and his young son Icarus (&#301;k&acute;&agrave;-r&#365;s).           <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
Day after day the little vessel sailed slowly southward,<br />
keeping the shore of the mainland always upon the right.<br />
It passed Tr&#339;zen and the rocky coast of Argos and then<br />
struck boldly out across the sea.<br />
</p><p>
At last the famous Island of Crete was reached, and      <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
there D&aelig;dalus landed and made himself known; and the<br />
King of Crete, who had already heard of his wondrous<br />
skill, welcomed him to his kingdom, and gave him a home<br />
in his palace, and promised that he should be rewarded<br />
with great riches and honor if he would but stay and practice         <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
his craft there as he had done in Athens.<br />
</p><p>
Now the name of the King of Crete was Minos. His<br />
grandfather, whose name was also Minos, was the son of<br />
Europa, a young princess whom a white bull, it was said,<br />
had brought on his back across the sea from distant Asia.<span class="linenum">25</span><br />
This elder Minos had been accounted the wisest of men&mdash;so<br />
wise, indeed, that Jupiter chose him to be one of the<br />
judges of the Lower World. The younger Minos was<br />
almost as wise as his grandfather; and he was brave and<br />
farseeing and skilled as a ruler of men. He had made all <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
the islands subject to his kingdom, and his ships sailed<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>into every part of the world and brought back to Crete<br />
the riches of foreign lands. So it was not hard for him to<br />
persuade D&aelig;dalus to make his home with him and be the<br />
chief of his artisans.<br />
</p><p>
And D&aelig;dalus built for King Minos a most wonderful<br />
palace with floors of marble and pillars of granite; and  <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
in the palace he set up golden statues which had tongues<br />
and could talk; and for splendor and beauty there was<br />
no other building in all the wide earth that could be compared<br />
with it.<br />
</p><p>
There lived in those days among the hills of Crete a     <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
terrible monster called the Minotaur (m&#301;n&acute;&#333;-t&ocirc;r), the like<br />
of which has never been seen from that time until now.<br />
This creature, it was said, had the body of a man but the<br />
face and head of a wild bull and the fierce nature of a<br />
mountain lion. The people of Crete would not have killed <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
him if they could; for they thought that the Mighty Folk<br />
who lived with Jupiter on the mountain top had sent him<br />
among them and that these beings would be angry if anyone<br />
should take his life. He was the pest and terror of<br />
all the land. Where he was least expected, there he was  <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
sure to be; and almost every day some man, woman, or<br />
child was caught and devoured by him.<br />
</p><p>
"You have done so many wonderful things," said the<br />
king to D&aelig;dalus, "can you not do something to rid the<br />
land of this Minotaur?"                                  <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
</p><p>
"Shall I kill him?" asked D&aelig;dalus.<br />
</p><p>
"Ah, no!" said the king. "That would only bring<br />
greater misfortune upon us."<br />
</p><p>
"I will build a house for him then," said D&aelig;dalus, "and<br />
you can keep him in it as a prisoner."                   <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
</p><p>
"But he may pine away and die if he is penned up in<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>prison," said the king.<br />
</p><p>
"He shall have plenty of room to roam about," said<br />
D&aelig;dalus; "and if you will only now and then feed one of<br />
your enemies to him, I promise you that he shall live and<br />
thrive."<br />
</p><p>
So the wonderful artisan brought together his workmen,    <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
and they built a marvelous house with so many rooms in<br />
it and so many winding ways that no one who went far<br />
into it could ever find his way out again; and D&aelig;dalus<br />
called it the Labyrinth and cunningly persuaded the<br />
Minotaur to go inside it. The monster soon lost his way  <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
among the winding passages, but the sound of his terrible<br />
bellowings could be heard day and night as he wandered<br />
back and forth vainly trying to find some place to escape.<br />
</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>
Not long after this it happened that D&aelig;dalus was guilty<br />
of a deed which angered the king very greatly; and had   <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
not Minos wished him to build other buildings for him, he<br />
would have put him to death and served him right.<br />
</p><p>
"Hitherto," said the king, "I have honored you for your<br />
skill and rewarded you for your labor. But now you shall<br />
be my slave and shall serve me without hire and without  <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
any word of praise."<br />
</p><p>
Then he gave orders to the guards at the city gates that<br />
they should not let D&aelig;dalus pass out at any time, and he<br />
set soldiers to watch the ships that were in port so that<br />
he could not escape by sea. But although the wonderful   <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
artisan was thus held as a prisoner, he did not build any<br />
more buildings for King Minos; he spent his time in planning<br />
how he might regain his freedom.<br />
</p><p>
"All my inventions," he said to his son Icarus, "have<br />
hitherto been made to please other people; now I will    <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>invent something to please myself."<br />
</p><p>
So through all the day he pretended to be planning some<br />
great work for the king, but every night he locked himself<br />
up in his chamber and wrought secretly by candlelight.<br />
By and by he had made for himself a pair of strong wings,<br />
and for Icarus another pair of smaller ones; and then,    <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
one midnight, when everybody was asleep, the two went<br />
out to see if they could fly. They fastened the wings<br />
to their shoulders with wax, and then sprang up into the<br />
air. They could not fly very far at first, but they did so<br />
well that they felt sure of doing much better in time.   <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
</p><p>
The next night D&aelig;dalus made some changes in the wings.<br />
He put on an extra strap or two; he took out a feather<br />
from one wing and put a new feather into another; and<br />
then he and Icarus went out into the moonlight to try<br />
them again. They did finely this time. They flew up to   <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
the top of the king's palace, and then they sailed away over<br />
the walls of the city and alighted on the top of a hill. But<br />
they were not ready to undertake a long journey yet;<br />
and so just before daybreak, they flew back home. Every<br />
fair night after that they practiced with their wings, and            <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
at the end of a month they felt as safe in the air as on the<br />
ground and could skim over the hilltops like birds.<br />
</p><p>
Early one morning, before King Minos had risen from<br />
his bed, they fastened on their wings, sprang into the air,<br />
and flew out of the city. Once fairly away from the island            <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
they turned towards the west, for D&aelig;dalus had heard of<br />
an island named Sicily which lay hundreds of miles away,<br />
and he had made up his mind to seek a new home there.<br />
</p><p>
All went well for a time, and the two bold flyers sped<br />
swiftly over the sea, skimming along only a little above <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
the waves, and helped on their way by the brisk east wind.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>Towards noon the sun shone very warm, and D&aelig;dalus<br />
called out to the boy, who was a little behind him, and told<br />
him to keep his wings cool and not fly too high. But the<br />
boy was proud of his skill in flying, and as he looked up at<br />
the sun he thought how nice it would be to soar like it<br />
high above the clouds in the blue depths of the sky.      <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
</p><p>
"At any rate," said he to himself, "I will go up a little<br />
higher. Perhaps I can see the horses which draw the sun<br />
car, and perhaps I shall catch sight of their driver, the<br />
mighty sun master himself."<br />
</p><p>
So he flew up higher and higher, but his father, who was <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
in front, did not see him. Pretty soon, however, the heat<br />
of the sun began to melt the wax with which the boy's<br />
wings were fastened. He felt himself sinking through the<br />
air; the wings had become loosened from his shoulders.<br />
He screamed to his father, but it was too late. D&aelig;dalus  <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
turned just in time to see Icarus fall headlong into the<br />
waves. The water was very deep there, and the skill of<br />
the wonderful artisan could not save his child. He could<br />
only look with sorrowing eyes at the unpitying sea, and<br />
fly on alone to distant Sicily. There, men say, he lived for          <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
many years, but he never did any great work nor built<br />
anything half so marvelous as the Labyrinth of Crete.<br />
And the sea in which poor Icarus was drowned was called<br />
forever afterward by his name, the Icarian Sea.<br />

<h2>CHARLEMAGNE AND ROLAND</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By H&eacute;l&egrave;ne A. Guerber</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A series of legends centers about the great emperor of France,
Charlemagne (shar&acute;l&#275;-m&#257;n), and his nephew Roland. Charlemagne's sister
Bertha had married an obscure knight, Milon, and had thus incurred the
anger of her brother. The following story suggests the reconciliation of
the two through the forwardness of Master Roland. Roland came to be
known as the greatest knight of continental Europe in the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>Read the selection with a view to understanding the characters of the
two chief personages.</p></div>


<p>
Numerous stories are told of the way in which<br />
Roland first attracted the attention of the great<br />
emperor, his uncle. Of these the most popular is that<br />
which relates how Milon, attempting to ford a stream, had<br />
been carried away and drowned, while his poor half-famished            <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
wife at home was thus left to perish of hunger. Seeing<br />
the signs of such acute distress around him, the child went<br />
boldly to the banqueting hall near by, where Charlemagne<br />
and his lords were feasting. Casting his eyes round for a<br />
suitable dish to plunder, Roland caught up a platter of  <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
food and fled. His fearless act greatly amused the emperor,<br />
who forbade his servants to interfere. Thus the boy<br />
carried off his prize in triumph, and soon set it before the<br />
startled eyes of his mother.<br />
</p><p>
Excited by the success of his raid, a few minutes later the           <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
child re&euml;ntered the hall, and with equal coolness laid hands<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>upon the emperor's cup, full of rich wine. Challenged by<br />
Charlemagne, the boy then boldly declared that he wanted<br />
the meat and wine for his mother, a lady of high degree.<br />
In answer to the emperor's bantering questions, he declared<br />
that he was his mother's cupbearer, her page, and<br />
her gallant knight, which answers so amused Charlemagne   <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
that he sent for her. He saw her to be his own sister, and,<br />
stricken with remorse, he asked for her forgiveness and<br />
treated her with kindness as long as she lived, and took her<br />
son into his service.<br />
</p><p>
Another legend relates that Charlemagne, hearing that    <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
the robber knight of the Ardennes had a priceless jewel<br />
set in his shield, called all his bravest noblemen together,<br />
and bade them sally forth separately, with only a page as<br />
escort, in quest of the knight. Once found, they were to<br />
challenge him in true knightly fashion, and at the point of           <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
the lance win the jewel he wore. A day was appointed<br />
when, successful or not, the courtiers were to return, and,<br />
beginning with the lowest in rank, were to give a truthful<br />
account of their adventures while on the quest.<br />
</p><p>
All the knights departed and scoured the forest of the   <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
Ardennes, each hoping to meet the robber knight and win<br />
the jewel. Among them was Milon, accompanied by his<br />
son Roland, a lad of fifteen, whom he had taken as page and<br />
armor-bearer. Milon had spent many days in vain search<br />
for the knight, when, exhausted by his long ride, he dismounted,     <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
removed his heavy armor, and lay down under a<br />
tree to sleep, bidding Roland keep close watch during his<br />
slumbers.<br />
</p><p>
For a while Roland watched faithfully; then, fired by a<br />
desire to distinguish himself, he donned his father's armor,          <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
sprang on his steed, and rode off into the forest in search of<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>adventures. He had not gone very far when he saw a<br />
gigantic horseman coming to meet him, and by the dazzling<br />
glitter of a large stone set in his shield he recognized him to<br />
be the invincible knight of the Ardennes. Afraid of<br />
nothing, however, he laid his lance in rest when challenged<br />
to fight, and charged so bravely that he unhorsed         <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
his opponent. A fearful battle on foot ensued, each striving<br />
hard to accomplish the death of the other. But at last the<br />
fresh young energy of Roland conquered, and his terrible<br />
foe fell to the ground in agony. A minute later his corpse<br />
lay stiff on the field, leaving the victory in the hands of           <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
Roland.<br />
</p><p>
Hastily wrenching the coveted jewel from the shield of<br />
the dead warrior, the boy hid it in his breast. Then, riding<br />
rapidly back to his sleeping father, he laid aside the armor<br />
and removed all traces of a bloody encounter. Soon after,<span class="linenum">15</span><br />
Milon awoke and resumed the quest, when he came upon<br />
the body of the dead knight. He was disappointed indeed<br />
to find that another had won the jewel, and rode sadly back<br />
to court, to be present on the appointed day.<br />
</p><p>
In much pomp Charlemagne ascended his throne amid        <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
the deafening sound of trumpets. Then, seating himself, he<br />
bade the knights appear before him and relate their adventures.<br />
One after another strode up the hall, followed by an<br />
armor-bearer holding his shield. Each in turn told of<br />
finding the knight slain and the jewel gone. Last of all <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
came Milon. Gloomily he made his way to the throne<br />
to repeat the story that had already been told so often.<br />
But as he went, there followed behind him, with a radiant<br />
face, young Roland, proudly bearing his father's shield,<br />
in the center of which shone the precious jewel. At the  <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
sight of this all the nobles started, and whispered to one<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>another that Milon had done the deed. Then when he<br />
dismally told how he too had found the knight dead a<br />
shout of incredulity greeted him. Turning his head, he<br />
saw to his amazement that his own shield bore the dazzling<br />
gem. At the sight of it he appeared so amazed that<br />
Charlemagne set himself to question Roland and thus soon  <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
learned how it had been obtained. In reward for his bravery<br />
in this encounter Roland was knighted, and allowed to<br />
take his place among the paladins of the emperor. Nor was<br />
it long before he further distinguished himself, becoming,<br />
to his father's delight, the most renowned of that famous<span class="linenum">10</span><br />
company.<br />

<h2>KEEPING THE BRIDGE</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Thomas Babington Macaulay</span></h3>

<p>
Ancient Rome stood on seven hills on the south shore of the Tiber      <span class="linenum2">5</span><br />
River, which formed a part of the inner defensive works of the city.<br />
Only one bridge&mdash;a wooden affair&mdash;spanned the river. Across the<br />
Tiber was the Janiculum, a hill fortified as an outer post of defense.<br />
</p><p>
When Lars Porsena (P&#335;r&acute;s&#277;-na), king of Etruria, declared sudden<br />
war on Rome, he marched on the city so rapidly that the Janiculum<br />
was carried by storm. Nothing stood between him and the City of<br />
the Seven Hills&mdash;unless the bridge were destroyed.       <span class="linenum2">10</span><br />
</p><p>
Horatius and two others elected to hold the bridgehead opposite<br />
the city against Porsena's entire army while the Romans cut down<br />
the bridge. The best of the Etruscan warriors came against the powerful<br />
three, only to be slain. Just before the bridge fell into the river,<br />
Horatius sent his two comrades back across the bridge to safety.<br />
He held his foes at bay single-handed till the structure fell into the  <span class="linenum2">15</span><br />
water. Then he plunged into the Tiber with his heavy fighting gear<br />
on, and swam to the Roman side. Thus was the city saved.<br />
</p>


<div>
Out spake the Consul roundly:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"The bridge must straight go down;</span><br />
For since Janiculum is lost,                             <span class="linenum2">20</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Naught else can save the town."</span><br />
Then out spake brave Horatius,                            <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Captain of the Gate:</span><br />
"To every man upon this earth<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Death cometh soon or late.</span><br />
And how can man die better                               <span class="linenum2">25</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Than facing fearful odds,  <span class="linenum">10</span></span><br />
For the ashes of his fathers<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the temples of his gods?</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span><br />
"Hew down the bridge, Sir Consul,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With all the speed ye may;</span><br />
I, with two more to help me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Will hold the foe in play.</span><br />
In yon strait path a thousand                             <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">May well be stopped by three.</span><br />
Now, who will stand on either hand,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And keep the bridge with me?"</span><br />
<br />
Then out spake Spurius Lartius,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A Ramnian proud was he: </span><span class="linenum">10</span><br />
"Lo, I will stand on thy right hand,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And keep the bridge with thee."</span><br />
And out spake strong Herminius,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of Titian blood was he:</span><br />
"I will abide on thy left side,                          <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And keep the bridge with thee."</span><br />
<br />
"Horatius," quoth the Consul,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"As thou say'st, so let it be."</span><br />
And straight against that great array<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Forth went the dauntless three.</span> <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
For Romans, in Rome's quarrel,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Spared neither land nor gold,</span><br />
Nor son nor wife, nor limb nor life,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the brave days of old.</span><br />
<br />
The three stood calm and silent,                         <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And looked upon the foes,</span><br />
And a great shout of laughter<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From all the vanguard rose. . . .</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span><br />
But soon Etruria's noblest<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Felt their hearts sink to see</span><br />
On the earth the bloody corpses,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the path the dauntless three!</span><br />
<br />
Meanwhile the ax and lever                                <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Have manfully been plied;</span><br />
And now the bridge hangs tottering<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Above the boiling tide.</span><br />
"Come back, come back, Horatius!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Loud cried the Fathers all; <span class="linenum">10</span></span><br />
"Back, Lartius! back, Herminius!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Back, ere the ruin fall!"</span><br />
<br />
Back darted Spurius Lartius;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Herminius darted back;</span><br />
And, as they passed, beneath their feet                  <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They felt the timbers crack.</span><br />
But when they turned their faces,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And on the farther shore</span><br />
Saw brave Horatius stand alone,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They would have crossed once more. <span class="linenum">20</span></span><br />
<br />
But, with a crash like thunder,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fell every loosened beam,</span><br />
And, like a dam, the mighty wreck<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lay right athwart the stream;</span><br />
And a long shout of triumph                              <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Rose from the walls of Rome,</span><br />
As to the highest turret tops<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was splashed the yellow foam.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span><br />
<br />Alone stood brave Horatius,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But constant still in mind;</span><br />
Thrice thirty thousand foes before,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the broad flood behind.</span><br />
"Down with him!" cried false Sextus,                      <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With a smile on his pale face.</span><br />
"Now yield thee!" cried Lars Porsena,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Now yield thee to our grace."</span><br />
<br />
Round turned he, as not deigning<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Those craven ranks to see; <span class="linenum">10</span></span><br />
Naught spake he to Lars Porsena,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To Sextus naught spake he;</span><br />
But he saw on Palatinus<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The white porch of his home;</span><br />
And he spake to the noble river                          <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That rolls by the towers of Rome:</span><br />
<br />
"O Tiber! Father Tiber!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To whom the Romans pray!</span><br />
A Roman's life, a Roman's arms,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Take thou in charge this day!" <span class="linenum">20</span></span><br />
So he spake, and speaking, sheathed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The good sword by his side,</span><br />
And with his harness on his back,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Plunged headlong in the tide.</span><br />
<br />
No sound of joy or sorrow                                <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was heard from either bank;</span><br />
But friends and foes, in dumb surprise,<br />
With parted lips and straining eyes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Stood gazing where he sank;</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span><br />
And when above the surges<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They saw his crest appear,</span><br />
All Rome sent forth a rapturous cry,<br />
And even the ranks of Tuscany<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Could scarce forbear to cheer. <span class="linenum">5</span></span><br />
<br />
"Curse on him!" quoth false Sextus;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Will not the villain drown?</span><br />
But for this stay, ere close of day<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We should have sacked the town!"</span><br />
"Heaven help him!" quoth Lars Porsena,                   <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"And bring him safe to shore;</span><br />
For such a gallant feat of arms<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was never seen before."</span><br />
<br />
And now the ground he touches,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now on dry earth he stands;  <span class="linenum">15</span></span><br />
Now round him throng the Fathers,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To press his gory hands;</span><br />
And now, with shouts and clapping,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And noise of weeping loud,</span><br />
He enters through the River Gate,                        <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Borne by the joyous crowd.</span><br />
<br />

<h2>THE STORY OF MOLLY PITCHER</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Frank R. Stockton</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The battle of Monmouth, N. J., was fought June 29, 1778. It was the
first battle the Americans had with the British after the terrible
winter at Valley Forge. It would have been a signal victory for
Washington's troops had General Charles Lee obeyed Washington's orders.
Notwithstanding Lee's acts, the American troops held their ground till
nightfall, when the British quietly retreated.</p></div>


<p>
At the battle of Monmouth, a young Irishwoman,<br />
wife of an artilleryman, played a very notable part<br />
in the working of the American cannon on that eventful<br />
day in June.<br />
</p><p>
Molly was born with the soul of a soldier, and although   <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
she did not belong to the army she much preferred going<br />
to war to staying at home and attending to domestic affairs.<br />
She was in the habit of following her husband on his various<br />
marches, and on the day of the Monmouth battle she was<br />
with him on the field.                                   <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
</p><p>
The day was very hot. The rays of the sun came down<br />
with such force that many of the soldiers were taken sick<br />
and some died; and the constant discharges of musketry<br />
and artillery did not make the air any cooler. Molly devoted<br />
herself to keeping her husband as comfortable as         <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
possible, and she made frequent trips to a spring not far<br />
away to bring him water; and on this account he was one<br />
of the freshest and coolest artillerymen on the ground.<br />
In fact, there was no man belonging to the battery who was<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>able to manage one of these great guns better than Pitcher.           <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
Returning from one of her trips to the spring, Molly<br />
had almost reached the place where her husband was<br />
stationed when a bullet from the enemy struck the poor<br />
man and stretched him dead, so that Molly had no sooner<br />
caught sight of her husband than she saw him fall. She    <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
ran to the gun, but scarcely had reached it before she heard<br />
one of the officers order the cannon to be wheeled back out<br />
of the way, saying that there was no one there who could<br />
serve it as it had been served.<br />
</p><p>
Now Molly's eyes flashed fire. One might have thought    <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
that she would have been prostrated with grief at the loss<br />
of her husband, but as we have said, she had within her<br />
the soul of a soldier. She had seen her husband, who was<br />
the same to her as a comrade, fall, and she was filled with<br />
an intense desire to avenge his death. She cried out to  <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
the officer not to send the gun away but to let her serve it;<br />
and scarcely waiting to hear what he would say, she sprang<br />
to the cannon and began to load it and fire it. She had so<br />
often attended her husband and even helped him in his<br />
work that she knew all about this sort of thing, and her <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
gun was managed well and rapidly.<br />
</p><p>
It might be supposed that it would be a very strange<br />
thing to see a woman on the battlefield firing a cannon;<br />
but even if the enemy had watched Molly with a spyglass,<br />
they would not have noticed anything to excite their surprise.        <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
She wore an ordinary skirt, like other women of<br />
the time; but over this was an artilleryman's coat and on<br />
her head was a cocked hat with some jaunty feathers stuck<br />
in it, so that she looked almost as much like a man as the<br />
rest of the soldiers of the battery.                     <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
</p><p>
During the rest of the battle Molly bravely served her<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>gun; and if she did as much execution in the ranks of the<br />
redcoats as she wanted to do, the loss in the regiments in<br />
front of her must have been very great. Of course all the<br />
men in the battery knew Molly Pitcher, and they watched<br />
her with the greatest interest and admiration. She would<br />
not allow anyone to take her place, but kept on loading and            <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
firing until the work of the day was done. Then the<br />
officers and men crowded about her with congratulations<br />
and praise.<br />
</p><p>
The next day General Greene went to Molly&mdash;whom he<br />
found in very much the condition in which she had left   <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
the battlefield, stained with dirt and powder, with her<br />
fine feathers gone and her cocked hat dilapidated&mdash;and<br />
conducted her, just as she was, to General Washington.<br />
When the commander in chief heard what she had done,<br />
he gave her warm words of praise. He determined to       <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
bestow upon her a substantial reward; for anyone who was<br />
brave enough and able enough to step in and fill an important<br />
place, as Molly had filled her husband's place,<br />
certainly deserved a reward. It was not according to the<br />
rules of war to give a commission to a woman; but as     <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
Molly had acted the part of a man, Washington considered<br />
it right to pay her for her services as if she had been a man.<br />
He therefore gave her the commission of a sergeant and<br />
recommended that her name be placed on the list of half-pay<br />
officers for life.                                       <span class="linenum">25</span><br />

<h2>KING PHILIP TO THE WHITE SETTLERS</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Edward Everett</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>For thirty years Massasoit was the firm friend of the early settlers in
New England. But when his son Philip came to rule over the Indian tribe
their former friendship for the whites was broken. In 1675 Philip led
his 10,000 warriors against the white settlers. King Philip's War lasted
into 1676 when Philip was captured and slain. The following is a
supposed speech of defiance that Philip delivered to the colonists.</p></div>


<p>
White man, there is eternal war between thee and<br />
me! I quit not the land of my fathers but with my<br />
life. In those woods where I bent my youthful bow, I will<br />
still hunt the deer. Over yonder waters I will still glide<br />
unrestrained in my bark canoe. By those dashing waterfalls<span class="linenum">5</span><br />
I will still lay up my winter's store of food. On these<br />
fertile meadows I will still plant my corn. Stranger, the<br />
land is mine! I understand not these paper rights. I gave<br />
not my consent when, as thou sayest, these broad regions<br />
were purchased, for a few baubles, of my fathers. They   <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
could sell what was theirs; they could sell no more. How<br />
could my fathers sell that which the Great Spirit sent me<br />
into the world to live upon? They knew not what they<br />
did. The stranger came, a timid suppliant, few and<br />
feeble, and asked to lie down on the red man's bearskin, and          <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
warm himself at the red man's fire, and have a little piece<br />
of land to raise corn for his women and children; and now<br />
he is become strong, and mighty, and bold, and spreads<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>out his parchment over the whole, and says, "It is mine!"<br />
Stranger, there is not room for us both. The Great Spirit<br />
has not made us to live together. There is poison in the<br />
white man's cup; the white man's dog barks at the red<br />
man's heels.<br />
</p><p>
If I should leave the land of my fathers, whither shall I <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
fly? Shall I go to the south, and dwell among the graves<br />
of the Pequots? Shall I wander to the west?&mdash;the fierce<br />
Mohawk, the man-eater, is my foe. Shall I fly to the east?&mdash;the<br />
great water is before me. No, stranger, here I have<br />
lived, and here I will die! And if here thou abidest, there           <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
is eternal war between thee and me. Thou hast taught<br />
me thy arts of destruction. For that alone I thank thee;<br />
and now take heed to thy steps; the red man is thy foe.<br />
When thou goest forth by day, my bullet shall whistle<br />
by thee; when thou liest down at night, my knife is at thy            <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
throat. The noonday sun shall not discover thy enemy,<br />
and the darkness of midnight shall not protect thy rest.<br />
Thou shalt plant in terror, and I will reap in blood; thou<br />
shalt sow the earth with corn, and I will strew it with ashes;<br />
thou shalt go forth with the sickle, and I will follow after         <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
with the scalping knife; thou shalt build, and I will burn,<br />
till the white man or the Indian shall cease from the land.<br />
Go thy way, for this time, in safety; but remember,<br />
stranger, there is eternal war between me and thee.<br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><br /><p>1. What reasons did Philip give for declaring war? To what extent were
his reasons good?</p>

<p>2. What did he mean by "paper rights"; "a timid suppliant"; "poison in

<h2>PIONEER LIFE IN OHIO</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By William Dean Howells</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>William Dean Howells (1837-1920) long held a position of leadership
among American writers of prose. In his many years of authorship he
produced novels, essays, criticism, plays, travel, and biography. For
ten years he was editor of the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>; and he was connected

<p>
It would not be easy to say where or when the first log<br />
cabin was built, but it is safe to say that it was somewhere<br />
in the English colonies of North America, and it is<br />
certain that it became the type of the settler's house<br />
throughout the whole Middle West. It may be called the    <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
American house, the Western house, the Ohio house.<br />
Hardly any other house was built for a hundred years by the<br />
men who were clearing the land for the stately mansions of<br />
our day. As long as the primeval forests stood, the log cabin<br />
remained the woodsman's home; and not fifty years ago    <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
I saw log cabins newly built in one of the richest and most<br />
prosperous regions of Ohio. They were, to be sure, log<br />
cabins of a finer pattern than the first settler reared. They<br />
were of logs handsomely shaped with the broadax; the<br />
joints between the logs were plastered with mortar; the  <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
chimney at the end was of stone; the roof was shingled,<br />
the windows were of glass, and the door was solid and well<br />
hung. They were such cabins as were the homes of the<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>well-to-do settlers in all the older parts of the West. But<br />
throughout that region there were many log cabins, mostly<br />
sunk to the uses of stables and corn cribs, of the kind that<br />
the borderers built in the times of the Indian War, from<br />
1750 to 1800. They were framed of the round logs, untouched<br />
by the ax except for the notches at the ends where        <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
they were fitted into one another; the chimney was of<br />
small sticks stuck together with mud, and was as frail<br />
as a barn-swallow's nest; the walls were stuffed with moss,<br />
plastered with clay; the floor was of rough boards called<br />
puncheons, riven from the block with a heavy knife; the  <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
roof was of clapboards, split from logs and laid loosely on<br />
the rafters and held in place with logs fastened athwart<br />
them.<br />
</p><p>
When the first settlers broke the silence of the woods<br />
with the stroke of their axes and hewed out a space for their        <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
cabins and their fields, they inclosed their homes with a<br />
high stockade of logs, for defense against the Indians; or<br />
if they built their cabins outside the wooden walls of their<br />
stronghold, they always expected to flee to it at the first<br />
alarm and to stand siege within it. The Indians had      <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
no cannon, and the logs of the stockade were proof against<br />
their rifles; if a breach was made, there was still the blockhouse<br />
left, the citadel of every little fort. This was heavily<br />
built, and pierced with loopholes for the riflemen within,<br />
whose wives ran bullets for them at its mighty hearth, and           <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
who kept the savage foe from its sides by firing down upon<br />
them through the projecting timbers of its upper story;<br />
but in many a fearful siege the Indians set the roof ablaze<br />
with arrows wrapped in burning tow, and then the fight<br />
became desperate indeed. After the Indian War ended,     <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
the stockade was no longer needed, and the settlers had<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>only the wild beasts to contend with, and those constant<br />
enemies of the poor in all ages and conditions&mdash;hunger<br />
and cold.<br />
</p><p>
They deadened the trees around them by girdling them<br />
with the ax, and planted the spaces between the leafless<br />
trunks with corn and beans and pumpkins. These were       <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
their necessaries, but they had an occasional luxury in the<br />
wild honey from the hollow of a bee tree when the bears<br />
had not got at it. In its season, there was an abundance<br />
of wild fruit, plums and cherries, haws and grapes, berries<br />
and nuts of every kind, and the maples yielded all the   <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
sugar they chose to make from them. But it was long<br />
before they had, at any time, the profusion which our<br />
modern arts enable us to enjoy the whole year round, and<br />
in the hard beginnings the orchard and the garden were<br />
forgotten for the fields. Their harvests must pay for the<span class="linenum">15</span><br />
acres bought of the government, or from some speculator<br />
who had never seen the land; and the settler must be<br />
prompt in paying, or else see his home pass from him after<br />
all his toil into the hands of strangers. He worked hard<br />
and he fared hard, and if he was safer when peace came,  <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
it is doubtful if he were otherwise more fortunate. As the<br />
game grew scarcer it was no longer so easy to provide food<br />
for his family; the change from venison and wild turkey<br />
to the pork which early began to prevail in his diet was<br />
hardly a wholesome one. Besides, in cutting down the     <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
trees he opened spaces to the sun which had been harmless<br />
enough in the shadow of the woods, but which now sent up<br />
their ague-breeding miasma. Ague was the scourge of<br />
the whole region, and it was hard to know whether the<br />
pestilence was worse on the rich levels beside the rivers, or        <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
on the stony hills where the settlers sometimes built to<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>escape it.<br />
</p><p>
When once the settler was housed against the weather,<br />
he had the conditions of a certain rude comfort indoors.<br />
If his cabin was not proof against the wind and rain or snow,<br />
its vast fireplace formed the means of heating, while the<br />
forest was an inexhaustible store of fuel. At first he dressed        <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
in the skins and pelts of the deer and fox and wolf, and his<br />
costume could have varied little from that of the red savage<br />
about him, for we often read how he mistook Indians<br />
for white men at first sight, and how the Indians in their<br />
turn mistook white men for their own people. The whole   <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
family went barefoot in the summer, but in winter the<br />
pioneer wore moccasins of buckskin and buckskin leggins<br />
or trousers; his coat was a hunting shirt belted at the<br />
waist and fringed where it fell to his knees. It was of<br />
homespun, a mixture of wool and flax called linsey-woolsey,          <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
and out of this the dresses of his wife and daughters were<br />
made. The wool was shorn from the sheep, which were so<br />
scarce that they were never killed for their flesh, except<br />
by the wolves, which were very fond of mutton but had<br />
no use for wool. For a wedding dress a cotton check was  <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
thought superb, and it really cost a dollar a yard; silks,<br />
satins, laces, were unknown. A man never left his house<br />
without his rifle; the gun was a part of his dress, and in<br />
his belt he carried a hunting knife and a hatchet; on his<br />
head he wore a cap of squirrel skin, often with the plume-like       <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
tail dangling from it.<br />
</p><p>
The furniture of the cabins was, like the clothing of<br />
the pioneers, homemade. A bedstead was contrived by<br />
stretching poles from forked sticks driven into the ground<br />
and laying clapboards across them; the bedclothes were   <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
bearskins. Stools, benches, and tables were roughed out<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>with auger and broadax; the puncheon floor was left bare,<br />
and if the earth formed the floor, no rug ever replaced the<br />
grass which was its first carpet. The cabin had but one<br />
room, where the whole of life went on by day; the father<br />
and mother slept there at night, and the children mounted<br />
to their chamber in the loft by means of a ladder.        <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
</p><p>
The food was what has been already named. The meat<br />
was venison, bear, raccoon, wild turkey, wild duck, and<br />
pheasant; the drink was water, or rye coffee, or whisky,<br />
which the little stills everywhere supplied only too abundantly.<br />
Wheat bread was long unknown, and corn cakes             <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
of various makings and bakings supplied its place. The<br />
most delicious morsel of all was corn grated while still in<br />
the milk and fashioned into round cakes eaten hot from<br />
the clapboard before the fire, or from the mysterious depths<br />
of the Dutch oven buried in coals and ashes on the hearth.           <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
There was soon a great flow of milk from the kine that<br />
multiplied in the pastures in the woods, and there was sweetening<br />
enough from the maple tree and the bee tree, but<br />
salt was very scarce and very dear, and long journeys<br />
were made through the perilous woods to and from the     <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
licks, or salt springs, which the deer had discovered before<br />
the white man or the red man knew them.<br />
</p><p>
The bees which hived their honey in the hollow trees<br />
were tame bees gone wild, and with the coming of the<br />
settlers some of the wild things increased so much that  <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
they became a pest. Such were the crows which literally<br />
blackened the fields after the settlers plowed, and which<br />
the whole family had to fight from the corn when it was<br />
planted. Such were the rabbits, and such, above all, were<br />
the squirrels, which overran the farms and devoured every<span class="linenum">30</span><br />
green thing till the people combined in great squirrel hunts<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>and destroyed them by tens of thousands. The larger<br />
game had meanwhile disappeared. The buffalo and the<br />
elk went first; the deer followed, and the bear, and even<br />
the useless wolf. But long after these the poisonous reptiles<br />
lingered, the rattlesnake, the moccasin, and the yet-deadlier<br />
copperhead; and it was only when the whole                <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
country was cleared that they ceased to be a very common<br />
danger.<br />

<h2>WITCHCRAFT</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Nathaniel Hawthorne</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Nathaniel Hawthorne (1804-1864) is one of the best-known figures in
American literature. He was a New Englander, and most of his writings
deal with events or situations located in New England. He was especially
happy in retelling old stories or in constructing tales from historical
events.</p></div>


<p>
Sir William Phips became Governor of Massachusetts<br />
in 1692. Almost as soon as he assumed the government<br />
he became engaged in a frightful business which<br />
might have perplexed a wiser and better-cultivated head<br />
than his. This was the witchcraft delusion, which originated          <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
in the wicked arts of a few children. They belonged<br />
to the Rev. Mr. Parris, minister of Salem. These children<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>complained of being pinched, and pricked with pins, and<br />
otherwise tormented, by the shapes of men and women,<br />
who were supposed to have power to haunt them invisibly<br />
both in darkness and daylight.<br />
</p><p>
Often in the midst of their family and friends the children<br />
would pretend to be seized with strange convulsions and   <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
would cry out that the witches were afflicting them. These<br />
stories spread abroad and caused great tumult and alarm.<br />
From the foundation of New England it had been the custom<br />
of the inhabitants, in matters of doubt and difficulty,<br />
to look to their ministers for counsel. So they did now; <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
but unfortunately the ministers and wise men were more<br />
deluded than the illiterate people. Cotton Mather, a<br />
very learned and eminent clergyman, believed that the<br />
whole country was full of witches and wizards who had<br />
given up their hopes of heaven and signed a covenant with<span class="linenum">15</span><br />
the Evil One.<br />
</p><p>
Nobody could be certain that his nearest neighbor or<br />
most intimate friend was not guilty of this imaginary crime.<br />
The number of those who pretended to be afflicted by<br />
witchcraft grew daily more numerous; and they bore       <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
testimony against many of the best and worthiest people.<br />
A minister named George Burroughs was among the<br />
accused. In the months of August and September, 1692,<br />
he and nineteen other innocent men and women were put<br />
to death. The place of execution was a high hill on the  <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
outskirts of Salem; so that many of the sufferers, as they<br />
stood beneath the gallows, could discern their habitations<br />
in the town.<br />
</p><p>
The killing of these guiltless persons served only to<br />
increase the madness. The afflicted now grew bolder in   <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
their accusations. Many people of rank and wealth were<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>either thrown into prison or compelled to flee for their<br />
lives. Among these were two sons of old Simon Bradstreet,<br />
the last of the Puritan governors. Mr. Willard, a pious<br />
minister of Boston, was cried out upon as a wizard in open<br />
court. Mrs. Hale, the wife of the minister of Beverly,<br />
was likewise accused. Philip English, a rich merchant of  <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
Salem, found it necessary to take flight, leaving his property<br />
and business in confusion. But a short time afterward<br />
the Salem people were glad to invite him back.<br />
</p><p>
The boldest thing the accusers did was to cry out against<br />
the Governor's own beloved wife. Yes, the lady of Sir    <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
William Phips was accused of being a witch and of flying<br />
through the air to attend witch meetings. When the<br />
Governor heard this, he probably trembled.<br />
</p><p>
Our forefathers soon became convinced that they had<br />
been led into a terrible delusion. All the prisoners on  <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
account of witchcraft were set free. But the innocent<br />
dead could not be restored to life, and the hill where they<br />
were executed will always remind people of the saddest<br />
and most humiliating passage in our history.<br />

<h2>TEA PARTIES IN OLD NEW YORK</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Washington Irving</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This extract portrays social life among the early Dutch settlers on the
island of Manhattan. It is written in Irving's deliciously humorous
style.</p></div>


<p>
In those happy days, a well-regulated family always<br />
rose with the dawn, dined at eleven, and went to bed<br />
at sundown. Dinner was invariably a private meal, and<br />
the fat old burghers showed incontestable symptoms of<br />
disapprobation and uneasiness on being surprised by a     <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
visit from a neighbor on such occasions. But though our<br />
worthy ancestors were thus singularly averse to giving<br />
dinners, yet they kept up the social bonds of intimacy by<br />
occasional banquetings, called tea parties.<br />
</p><p>
As this is the first introduction of those delectable orgies         <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
which have since become so fashionable in this city, I am<br />
conscious my fair readers will be very curious to receive<br />
information on the subject. Sorry am I that there will be<br />
but little in my description calculated to excite their admiration.<br />
I can neither delight them with accounts of suffocating  <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
crowds, nor brilliant drawing rooms, nor towering<br />
feathers, nor sparkling diamonds, nor immeasurable trains.<br />
</p><p>
I can detail no choice anecdotes of scandal, for in those<br />
primitive times the simple folk were either too stupid or<br />
too good-natured to pull each other's characters to pieces;          <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
nor can I furnish any whimsical anecdotes of brag&mdash;how<br />
one lady cheated or another bounced into a passion; for<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>as yet there was no junto of dulcet old dowagers who met<br />
to win each other's money and lose their own tempers at<br />
a card table.<br />
</p><p>
These fashionable parties were generally confined to the<br />
higher classes, or <i>noblesse</i>; that is to say, such as kept their<br />
own cows and drove their own wagons. The company          <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
commonly assembled at three o'clock and went away about<br />
six, unless it was winter time, when the fashionable hours<br />
were a little earlier, that the ladies might get home before<br />
dark. I do not find that they ever treated their company<br />
to ice creams, jellies, or sillabubs, or regaled them with           <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
musty almonds, moldy raisins, or sour oranges, as is often<br />
done in the present age of refinement. Our ancestors were<br />
fond of more sturdy, substantial fare. The tea table was<br />
crowned with a huge earthen dish, well stored with slices<br />
of fat pork, fried brown, cut up into morsels, and swimming          <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
in gravy.<br />
</p><p>
The company, being seated around the genial board and<br />
each furnished with a fork, evinced their dexterity in<br />
launching at the fattest pieces of this mighty dish in much<br />
the same manner as sailors harpoon porpoises at sea or   <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
our Indians spear salmon in the lakes. Sometimes the<br />
table was graced with immense apple pies or saucers full<br />
of preserved peaches and pears; but it was always sure to<br />
boast of an enormous dish of balls of sweetened dough<br />
fried in hog's fat and called doughnuts; a delicious kind<span class="linenum">25</span><br />
of cake, at present scarce known in this city except in genuine<br />
Dutch families.<br />
</p><p>
The tea was served out of a majestic delft teapot ornamented<br />
with paintings of fat little Dutch shepherds and<br />
shepherdesses tending pigs, with boats sailing in the air<span class="linenum">30</span><br />
and houses built in the clouds, and sundry other ingenious<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>Dutch fantasies. The beaux distinguished themselves by<br />
their adroitness in replenishing this pot from a huge copper<br />
teakettle which would have made the pigmy macaronis<br />
of these degenerate days sweat merely to look at it. To<br />
sweeten the beverage, a lump of sugar was laid beside each<br />
cup, and the company alternately nibbled and sipped with  <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
great decorum; until an improvement was introduced<br />
by a shrewd and economic old lady, which was to suspend<br />
a large lump directly over the tea table by a string from<br />
the ceiling, so that it could be swung from mouth to mouth&mdash;an<br />
ingenious expedient, which is still kept up by some      <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
families in Albany, but which prevails without exception<br />
in Communipaw, Bergen, Flatbush, and all our uncontaminated<br />
Dutch villages.<br />
</p><p>
At these primitive tea parties the utmost propriety and<br />
dignity of deportment prevailed. No flirting nor coquetting;         <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
no gambling of old ladies nor hoyden chattering and<br />
romping of young ones; no self-satisfied struttings of<br />
wealthy gentlemen with their brains in their pockets nor<br />
amusing conceits and monkey divertisements of smart<br />
young gentlemen with no brains at all.                   <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
</p><p>
The parties broke up without noise and without confusion.<br />
They were carried home by their own carriages; that<br />
is to say, by the vehicles nature had provided them, excepting<br />
such of the wealthy as could afford to keep a wagon.<br />

<h2>A SCHOOL OF LONG AGO</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Edward Eggleston</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The following description of a pioneer school in Pennsylvania affords a
fine opportunity to study the methods of teaching then in vogue. Many of
them may appeal to us as being ludicrous; but undoubtedly Dock's
teaching was in many ways far in advance of the times, when the usual
and most-approved method of "imparting knowledge" consisted in beating
ideas into pupils' heads with hickory switches.</p></div>


<p>
A hundred and fifty years ago there was a famous<br />
teacher among the German settlers in Pennsylvania,<br />
who was known as "The Good Schoolmaster." His name<br />
was Christopher Dock, and he had two little country schools.<br />
For three days he would teach at a little place called Skippack,      <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
and then for the next three days he would teach at<br />
Salford.<br />
</p><p>
People said that the good schoolmaster never lost his<br />
temper. There was a man who thought he would try to<br />
make him angry. He said many harsh and abusive words     <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
to the teacher, and even cursed him; but the only reply<br />
the teacher made was, "Friend, may the Lord have mercy<br />
on you."<br />
</p><p>
Other schoolmasters used to beat their scholars severely<br />
with whips and long switches; but Schoolmaster Dock      <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
had found a better way. When a child came to school for<br />
the first time, the other scholars were made to give the<br />
new scholar a welcome by shaking hands with him one<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>after another. Then the new boy or girl was told that<br />
this was not a harsh school but a place for those who would<br />
behave. And if a scholar were lazy, disobedient, or stubborn,<br />
the master would in the presence of the whole school<br />
pronounce him not fit for this school but only for a school<br />
where children were flogged. The new scholar was asked    <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
to promise to obey and to be diligent. When he had made<br />
this promise, he was shown to a seat.<br />
</p><p>
"Now," the good master would say, when this was<br />
done, "who will take this new scholar and help him to<br />
learn?" When the new boy or girl was clean and bright    <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
looking, many would be willing to take charge of him or<br />
her; but there were few ready to teach a dirty, ragged little<br />
child. Sometimes no one would wish to do it. In such a<br />
case the master would offer to the one who would take such<br />
a child a reward of one of the beautiful texts of Scripture          <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
which the schoolmasters of that time used to write and<br />
decorate for the children. Or he would give him one of<br />
the pictures of birds which he was accustomed to paint<br />
with his own hands.<br />
</p><p>
Whenever one of the younger scholars succeeded in        <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
learning his A, B, C, Christopher Dock would send word<br />
to the father of the child to give him a penny, and he would<br />
ask his mother to cook two eggs for him as a treat. These<br />
were fine rewards for poor children in a new country.<br />
</p><p>
There were no clocks or watches in the country. The      <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
children came to school one after another, taking their<br />
places near the master, who sat writing. They spent<br />
their time reading until all were there; but everyone who<br />
succeeded in reading his passage without mistake stopped<br />
reading and came and sat at the writing table to write.  <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
The poor fellow who remained last on the bench was called<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>the Lazy Scholar.<br />
</p><p>
Every Lazy Scholar had his name written on the blackboard.<br />
If a child at any time failed to read correctly, he<br />
was sent back to study his passage and called again after<br />
a while. If he failed a second or a third time, all the scholars<br />
cried out, "Lazy!" Then his name was written on           <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
the blackboard, and all the poor Lazy Scholar's friends<br />
went to work to teach him to read his lesson correctly. And<br />
if his name should not be rubbed off the board before school<br />
was dismissed, all the scholars might write it down and<br />
take it home with them. But if he could read well before <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
school was out, the scholars, at the bidding of the master,<br />
called out, "Industrious!" and then his name was erased.<br />
</p><p>
The funniest of Dock's rewards was that which he gave<br />
to those who made no mistake in their lessons. He marked<br />
a large O with chalk on the hand of the perfect scholar. <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
Fancy what a time the boys and girls must have had, trying<br />
to go home without rubbing out this O!<br />
</p><p>
If you had gone into this school some day, you might<br />
have seen a boy sitting on a punishment bench, all alone.<br />
This was a fellow who had told a lie or used bad language.           <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
He was put there as not fit to sit near anybody else. If<br />
he committed the offense often, a yoke would be put round<br />
his neck, as if he were a brute. Sometimes, however, the<br />
teacher would give the scholars their choice of a blow on<br />
the hand or a seat on the punishment bench. They usually <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
preferred the blow.<br />
</p><p>
The old schoolmaster in Skippack wrote one hundred<br />
rules of good behavior for his scholars. This is perhaps the<br />
first book on good manners written in America. But rules<br />
of behavior for people living in houses of one or two rooms,         <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
as they did in that day, were very different from those<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>needed in our time. Here are some of the rules:<br />
</p><p>
"When you comb your hair, do not go out in the middle<br />
of the room," says the schoolmaster. This was because families<br />
were accustomed to eat and sleep in the same room.<br />
</p><p>
"Do not eat your morning bread on the road or in school,"<br />
he tells them, "but ask your parents to give it to you at <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
home." From this we see that the common breakfast<br />
was bread alone, and that the children often ate it as they<br />
walked to school.<br />
</p><p>
"Put your knife upon the right and your bread on the<br />
left side," he says. Forks were little used in those days,           <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
and the people in the country did not have any. He also<br />
tells them not to throw bones under the table. It was a<br />
common practice among some people of that time to throw<br />
bones and scraps under the table, where the dogs ate them.<br />
</p><p>
As time passed on, Christopher Dock had many friends,    <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
for all his scholars of former years loved him greatly. He<br />
lived to be very old, and taught his schools to the last.<br />
One evening he did not come home, and the people went<br />
to look for the beloved old man. They found their dear<br />
old master on his knees in the schoolhouse. He had died  <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
while praying alone.<br />

<h2>FRENCH LIFE IN THE NORTHWEST</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By James Baldwin</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>You will recall that the French explorers Marquette, Joliet, La Salle,
and others established missions and trading posts in the Illinois
country. It was due to these early explorations that the French got
control of a large part of the Northwest Territory.</p>

<p>The following narrative tells of the simple life of the French settlers
in that territory.</p></div>


<p>
It is interesting to learn how the French people in the<br />
Illinois country lived in friendship with the savage<br />
tribes around them. The settlements were usually small<br />
villages on the edge of a prairie or in the heart of the woods.<br />
They were always near the bank of a river; for the watercourses       <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
were the only roads and the light canoes of the<br />
<i>voyageurs</i> were the only means of travel. There the French<br />
settlers lived like one great family, having for their rulers<br />
the village priest and the older men of the community.<br />
</p><p>
The houses were built along a single narrow street and so<span class="linenum">10</span><br />
close together that the villagers could carry on their<br />
neighborly gossip each from his own doorstep. These<br />
houses were made of a rude framework of corner posts,<br />
studs, and crossties, and were plastered, outside and in,<br />
with "cat and clay"&mdash;a kind of mortar, made of mud and   <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
mixed with straw and moss. Around each house was a<br />
picket fence, and the forms of the dooryards and gardens<br />
were regulated by the village lawgivers.<br />
</p><p>
Adjoining the village was a large inclosure, or "common<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>field," for the free use of all the villagers. The size of           <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
this field depended upon the number of families in the<br />
settlement; it sometimes contained several hundred acres.<br />
It was divided into plots or allotments, one for each household,<br />
and the size of the plot was proportioned according<br />
to the number of persons in the family. Each household    <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
attended to the cultivation of its own ground and gathered<br />
its own harvest. And if anyone should neglect to care for<br />
his plot and let it become overgrown with weeds and thistles,<br />
he forfeited his right to any part of the common field and<br />
his ground was given to another.                         <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
</p><p>
Surrounding the common field was a large tract of<br />
cleared land that was used as a common pasture ground.<br />
In some cases there were thousands of acres in this tract,<br />
and yet no person was allowed to use any part of it except<br />
for the pasturage of his stock. When a new family came   <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
into the settlement or a newly married couple began housekeeping,<br />
a small part of the pasture ground was taken into<br />
the common field, in order to give the new household its<br />
proper allotment.<br />
</p><p>
The priest occupied the place of father to all the villagers,        <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
whether white or red. They confided all their troubles to<br />
him. He was their oracle in matters of learning as well as<br />
of religion. They obeyed his word as law.<br />
</p><p>
The great business of all was fur trading and the care of<br />
their little plots of ground. The women kept their homes <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
in order, tended their gardens, and helped with the plowing<br />
and the harvesting. The men were the protectors of the<br />
community. Some were soldiers, some were traders, but<br />
most were engaged in hunting and in gathering beaver skins<br />
and buffalo hides to be sold to the traders.             <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
</p><p>
The traders kept a small stock of French goods&mdash;laces,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>ribbons, and other articles, useful and ornamental&mdash;and<br />
these they exchanged for the products of the forest. The<br />
young men, as a rule, sought business and pleasure in the<br />
great woods. Some of them became <i>voyageurs</i>, or boatmen,<br />
in the service of the traders. In their light canoes they<br />
explored every rivulet and stream and visited the distant <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
tribes among the sources of the Mississippi and Missouri.<br />
Others took to the forest as woods rangers, or <i>coureurs de<br />
bois</i>, and became almost as wild as the Indians themselves.<br />
They wandered wherever their fancy led them, hunting<br />
game, trapping beavers, and trading with their dusky     <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
friends. Those who roamed in the Lake regions built here<br />
and there small forts of logs and surrounded them with<br />
palisades. In one of these forts a company of two or three<br />
<i>coureurs</i> would remain for a few weeks and then leave it<br />
to be occupied by anyone who might next come that way.   <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
A post of this kind was built at Detroit long before any<br />
permanent settlement was made there; and scattered long<br />
distances apart on the Lake shore and in the heart of the<br />
wilderness, were many others.<br />
</p><p>
The northern <i>coureurs</i>, when returning from the woods,         <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
resorted to Mackinac as their headquarters; or loaded<br />
with beaver skins they made their way to Montreal,<br />
where they conducted themselves in a manner that would<br />
have shamed a Mohawk or a Sioux. But the rangers<br />
of the Illinois country were in the habit of returning once          <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
each year to their village homes. There they were welcomed<br />
with joy, balls and festivals were given in their<br />
honor, and old and young gathered around them to hear<br />
the story of their adventures.<br />
</p><p>
Thus in the heart of the wilderness, these French settlers           <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
passed their lives in the enjoyment of unbounded freedom.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>They delighted in amusements and there were almost as<br />
many holidays as working days. Being a thousand miles<br />
from any center of civilization they knew but little of what<br />
was taking place in the world. In their hearts they were<br />
devoted to their mother country; they believed that<br />
"France ruled the world and therefore all must be right." <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
Further than this they troubled themselves but little.<br />
They were contented and happy and seldom allowed<br />
themselves to be annoyed by the perplexing cares of<br />
business.<br />
</p><p>
They had no wish to subdue the wilderness&mdash;to hew        <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
down the forest, and make farms, and build roads, and<br />
bring civilization to their doors. To do this would be to<br />
change the modes of living that were so dear to them. It<br />
would destroy the fur trade, and then what would become<br />
of the traders, the <i>voyageurs</i>, and the <i>coureurs<span class="linenum">15</span><br />
de bois?</i> These French settlers were not the kind of people to<br />
found colonies and build empires.<br />
</p><p>
We are indebted to Father Marest for a description<br />
of the daily routine of life among the converts and French<br />
settlers at Kaskaskia. At early dawn his pupils came to  <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
him in the church, where they had prayers and all joined<br />
in singing hymns. Then the Christians in the village met<br />
together to hear him say Mass&mdash;the women standing on<br />
one side of the room, the men on the other.<br />
</p><p>
The French women were dressed in prettily colored        <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
jackets and short gowns of homemade woolen stuffs or of<br />
French goods of finer texture. In summer most of them<br />
were barefooted, but in winter and on holidays they wore<br />
Indian moccasins gayly decorated with porcupine quills,<br />
shells, and colored beads. Instead of hats they wore     <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
bright-colored handkerchiefs, interlaced with gay ribbons<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>and sometimes wreathed with flowers.<br />
</p><p>
The men wore long vests drawn over their shirts, leggings<br />
of buckskin or of coarse woolen cloth, and wooden clog<br />
shoes or moccasins of heavy leather. In winter they<br />
wrapped themselves in long overcoats with capes and hoods<br />
that could be drawn over their heads and thus serve for   <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
hats. In summer their heads were covered with blue<br />
handkerchiefs worn turbanlike as a protection from mosquitoes<br />
as well as from the rays of the sun.<br />
</p><p>
After the morning devotions were over, each person<br />
betook himself to whatever business or amusement was     <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
most necessary or congenial; and the priest went out to<br />
visit the sick, giving them medicine and consoling them in<br />
whatever way he could. In the afternoon those who chose<br />
to do so came again to the church to be taught the catechism.<br />
During the rest of the day the priest walked about       <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
the village, talking with old and young and entering into<br />
sympathy with all their hopes and plans. In the evening<br />
the people would meet together again to chant the hymns<br />
of the church. This daily round of duty and devotion<br />
was often varied by the coming of holidays and festivals <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
and sometimes by occurrences of a sadder nature&mdash;death,<br />
or misfortune, or the threatened invasion of savage foes.<br />

<h2>A BEAR STORY</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Maurice Thompson</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Not the least of the perils of the pioneers were the wild animals of the
forest. Bears, wolves, and panthers were the worst terrors. Mothers were
in constant fear of their children straying away from the cabin into the
woods where four-footed danger lurked.</p></div>


<p>
A man and his wife with three children&mdash;a boy aged nine<br />
and two little girls, the elder seven and the younger<br />
five years old&mdash;lived in a comfortable cabin not far from<br />
the eastern line of Indiana. Their nearest neighbor was<br />
six or seven miles distant, and all around their little clearing      <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
stood a wall of dense forest. The father tended a small<br />
field of corn and vegetables, but their main dependence for<br />
food was upon the game killed by him, so he was often<br />
absent all day in the woods, hunting deer and turkeys.<br />
</p><p>
The children were forbidden to go outside the inclosure  <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
while their father was away, and the mother, at the slightest<br />
hint of danger, was instructed to close the door and bar it<br />
and shut the portholes. But even in times of such danger,<br />
people grew careless and permitted themselves to take<br />
risks in a way quite incredible to our minds. Children   <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
were restless when confined to a cabin or within a small<br />
yard, when the green woods were but a few steps away,<br />
with flowers blooming and rich mosses growing all around.<br />
They constantly longed to be free, if only for a few moments,<br />
to wander at will and make playhouses in the dusky shade,<span class="linenum">20</span><br />
to climb upon the great logs and watch the gay-winged<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>birds flit about in the foliage on high.<br />
</p><p>
One day in early spring the father went to the woods to<br />
hunt. Before setting forth with his rifle on his shoulder,<br />
he particularly charged his wife not to permit the children,<br />
no matter how much they begged and cried for it, to go<br />
outside the yard.                                         <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
</p><p>
"At this time of the year," he said, "bears and all other<br />
wild beasts are cross. They wander everywhere and are<br />
very dangerous when met with. Watch the children."<br />
</p><p>
The wife did try faithfully to keep her eyes upon her<br />
darlings; but she had many household duties to perform,  <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
and so at last she forgot.<br />
</p><p>
The spring was very early that year, and although it<br />
was not yet May, the green tassels were on the maples and<br />
the wild flowers made the ground gay in places. All around<br />
the clearing ran a ripple of bird song. The sunshine was <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
dreamy, the wind soft and warm.<br />
</p><p>
The little boy felt the temptation. It was as if a sweet<br />
voice called him to the wood. Nor were the little girls<br />
less attracted than he by the thought of gathering mosses<br />
and flowers and running at will under the high old trees.<span class="linenum">20</span><br />
</p><p>
Before their mother knew it, they were gone. She had<br />
not yet discovered their truancy when a cry coming from<br />
some distance startled her; it was her little boy's voice<br />
screaming lustily, and upon looking out she saw all three<br />
of the children running as fast as they could across the <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
clearing from the wood toward the house. Behind them,<br />
at a slow, peculiar lope, a huge bear followed.<br />
</p><p>
Frightened almost to death, the poor woman scarcely<br />
knew what she was doing; but she had the fighting instinct<br />
of all backwoods people, and her first motion was to snatch          <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
off the wall, where it lay in a deer's-horn rest, a large horse<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>pistol. With this in hand she ran to meet her children.<br />
Some hunter had broken the bear's fore leg with a bullet<br />
a few days before, which accounted for its strange, waddling<br />
gait; but it was almost within reach of the hindmost child<br />
when the mother arrived. The bear at once turned its<br />
attention to the newcomer, and with a terrific snarl rushed           <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
at her. On sped the children, screaming and crazy with<br />
fright. It was a moment of imminent peril to the mother,<br />
but she was equal to the occasion. She leveled the pistol<br />
and fired. Six leaden slugs struck the bear in the head<br />
and neck, knocking it over.                              <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
</p><p>
Not very far away in the woods at the time, the man<br />
heard the loud report, and fearing that Indians were murdering<br />
his family, he ran home to find his wife just reviving<br />
from a swoon. She had fainted immediately after seeing<br />
the effect of her shot.                                  <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
</p><p>
The bear was not yet dead, but a ball from the rifle finished<br />
him. He was a monster in size. Doubtless the<br />
wound in his fore leg had made it difficult for him to get<br />
food, and he had attacked the children on account of sheer<br />
hunger. But had he not been in that maimed condition,    <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
his attack would have been successful and the hindmost<br />
child would have been torn to pieces and eaten up in the<br />
shortest time and with little show of table manners.<br />

<h2>A PATRIOT OF GEORGIA</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Joel Chandler Harris</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Many of the most interesting incidents of the
Revolutionary War are buried in old state
documents, in family records, or in stray personal
letters. Others are largely traditional; for our
ancestors of pioneer days were doers rather than
chroniclers of their doings.</p>

<p>The following event is largely legendary, but none
the less true. It is dramatically told here by the
author of the Uncle Remus stories.</p></div>


<p>
The Revolutionary War in Georgia developed some<br />
very romantic figures, which are known to us rather<br />
by tradition than by recorded history. First among them,<br />
on the side of the patriots, was Robert Sallette. Neither<br />
history nor tradition gives us the place of his birth or the          <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
date of his death; yet it is known that he played a more<br />
important part in the struggle in the colony than any man<br />
who had no troops at his command. He seems to have<br />
slipped mysteriously on the scene at the beginning of the<br />
war. He fought bravely, even fiercely, to the end; and   <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
then, having nothing else to do, slipped away as mysteriously<br />
as he came.<br />
</p><p>
Curious as we may be to know something of the personal<br />
history of Robert Sallette, it is not to be found chronicled<br />
in the books. The French twist to his name makes it      <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
probable that he was a descendant of those unfortunate<br />
Acadians who, years before, had been stripped of their<br />
lands and possessions in Nova Scotia by the British, their<br />
houses and barns burned, and they themselves transported<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>away from their homes. They were scattered at various    <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
points along the American coast. Some were landed at<br />
Philadelphia, and some were carried to Louisiana. Four<br />
hundred were sent to Georgia. The British had many acts<br />
of cruelty to answer for in those days, but none more infamous<br />
than this treatment of the gentle and helpless            <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
Acadians. It stands in history to-day a stain upon the<br />
British name.<br />
</p><p>
Another fact that leads to the belief that Robert Sallette<br />
was a descendant of the unfortunate Acadians was the<br />
ferocity with which he pursued the British and the Tories.           <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
The little that is told about him makes it certain that he<br />
never gave quarter to the enemies of his country.<br />
</p><p>
His name was a terror to the Tories. One of them, a<br />
man of considerable means, offered a reward of one hundred<br />
guineas to any person who would bring him the head of    <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
Robert Sallette. The Tory had never seen Sallette, but<br />
his alarm was such that he offered a reward large enough<br />
to tempt some one to assassinate the daring partisan.<br />
When Sallette heard of the reward, he disguised himself<br />
as a farmer, and provided himself with a pumpkin, which  <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
he placed in a bag. With the bag swinging across his<br />
shoulder, he made his way to the house of the Tory. He<br />
was invited in, and deposited the bag on the floor beside<br />
him, the pumpkin striking the boards with a thump.<br />
</p><p>
"I have brought you the head of Robert Sallette," said   <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
he. "I hear that you have offered a reward of one hundred<br />
guineas for it."<br />
</p><p>
"Where is it?" asked the Tory.<br />
</p><p>
"I have it with me," replied Sallette, shaking the loose<br />
end of the bag. "Count out the money and take the head." <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
</p><p>
The Tory, neither doubting nor suspecting, counted out<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>the money and placed it on the table.<br />
</p><p>
"Now show me the head," said he.<br />
</p><p>
Sallette removed his hat, tapped himself on the forehead,<br />
and said, "Here is the head of Robert Sallette!"<br />
</p><p>
The Tory was so frightened that he jumped from the<br />
room, and Sallette pocketed the money and departed.       <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><br /><p>1. Who was Sallette? What guess does the author
make as to his nationality? Why?</p>

<p>2. Relate the incident told.</p>

<p>3. Explain the meaning of: Tory, Acadians,

<h2>COLUMBUS AND THE ECLIPSE</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By James Johonnot</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This incident is related to show, first, something
of the character of Columbus, and, second, the
superstitions of the Indians. Read it to determine
what the author wished to bring out about Columbus.
Was Columbus justified in deceiving the Indians?</p></div>


<p>
When Columbus first landed upon the shores of the<br />
New World, and for a long time after, the natives<br />
thought that he had come down from heaven, and they<br />
were ready to do anything for this new friend. But at<br />
one place, where he stayed for some months, the chiefs    <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
became jealous of him and tried to drive him away. It had<br />
been their custom to bring food for him and his companions<br />
every morning, but now the amount they brought was very<br />
small, and Columbus saw that he would soon be starved<br />
unless he could make a change.                           <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
</p><p>
Now Columbus knew that in a few days there was to be<br />
an eclipse of the sun; so he called the chiefs around him<br />
and told them that the Great Spirit was angry with them<br />
for not doing as they agreed in bringing him provisions, and<br />
that to show his anger, on such a day, he would cause the<span class="linenum">15</span><br />
sun to be darkened. The Indians listened, but they did<br />
not believe Columbus and there was a still greater falling<br />
off in the amount of the food sent in.<br />
</p><p>
On the morning of the day set, the sun rose clear and<br />
bright, and the Indians shook their heads as they thought<span class="linenum">20</span><br />
how Columbus had tried to deceive them. Hour after<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>hour passed and still the sun was bright, and the Spanish<br />
began to fear that the Indians would attack them soon, as<br />
they seemed fully convinced that Columbus had deceived<br />
them. But at length a black shadow began to steal over<br />
the face of the sun. Little by little the light faded and<br />
darkness spread over the land.                            <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
</p><p>
The Indians saw that Columbus had told them the truth.<br />
They saw that they had offended the Great Spirit and that<br />
he had sent a dreadful monster to swallow the sun. They<br />
could see the jaws of this horrible monster slowly closing<br />
to shut off their light forever. Frantic with fear, they filled      <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
the air with cries and shrieks. Some fell prostrate before<br />
Columbus and entreated his help; some rushed off and<br />
soon returned laden with every kind of provisions they could<br />
lay their hands on. Columbus then retired to his tent and<br />
promised to save them if possible. About the time for the<span class="linenum">15</span><br />
eclipse to pass away, he came out and told them that the<br />
Great Spirit had pardoned them this time and he would soon<br />
drive away the monster from the sun; but they must never<br />
offend in that way again.<br />
</p><p>
The Indians promised, and waited. As the sun began       <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
to come out from the shadow their fears subsided, and<br />
when it shone clear once more, their joy knew no bounds.<br />
They leaped, they danced, and they sang. They thought<br />
Columbus was a god, and while he remained on the island<br />
the Spaniards had all the provisions they needed.        <span class="linenum">25</span><br />

<h2>FIRST THANKSGIVING DAY PROCLAMATION</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By George Washington</span>, 1789</h3>


<p>
Now, therefore, I do recommend and assign Thursday,<br />
the 26th day of November next, to be devoted by<br />
the people of these states to the service of that great and<br />
glorious Being, who is the beneficent author of all the good<br />
that was, that is, or that will be. That we may then all  <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
unite in the rendering unto Him our sincere and humble<br />
thanks for His kind care and protection of the people of<br />
this country previous to their becoming a nation&mdash;for the<br />
single and manifold mercies, and for the favorable interpellation<br />
of His providence, in the course and conclusion of       <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
the late war.<br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><br /><p>1. This old document comes down to us with a fine
message of inspiration from the past and from its
great author. Explain the reference in line 8; in
lines 10 and 11. Compare this proclamation with the
President's proclamation for the current year.</p></div>

<h2>THANKSGIVING DAY PROCLAMATION, 1905</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Theodore Roosevelt</span></h3>

<p>
When, nearly three centuries ago, the first settlers<br />
came to the country which has now become this<br />
great republic, they fronted not only hardship and privation,<br />
but terrible risk to their lives. In those grim years the<br />
custom grew of setting apart one day in each year for a   <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
special service of thanksgiving to the Almighty for preserving<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>the people through the changing seasons. The<br />
custom has now become national and hallowed by immemorial<br />
usage. We live in easier and more plentiful<br />
times than our forefathers, the men who with rugged<br />
strength faced the rugged days; and yet the dangers to<br />
national life are quite as great now as at any previous time          <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
in our history. It is eminently fitting that once a year our<br />
people should set apart a day for praise and thanksgiving<br />
to the Giver of Good, and, at the same time that they<br />
express their thankfulness for the abundant mercies received,<br />
should manfully acknowledge their shortcomings           <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
and pledge themselves solemnly and in good faith to strive<br />
to overcome them. During the past year we have been<br />
blessed with plentiful crops. Our business prosperity has<br />
been great. No other people has ever stood on as high a<br />
level of material well-being as ours now stands. We are  <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
not threatened by foes from without. The foes from whom<br />
we should pray to be delivered are our own passions, appetites,<br />
and follies; and against these there is always need<br />
that we should war.<br />
</p><p>
Therefore, I now set apart Thursday, the thirtieth day   <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
of this November, as a day of thanksgiving for the past and<br />
of prayer for the future, and on that day I ask that throughout<br />
the land the people gather in their homes and places of<br />
worship, and in rendering thanks unto the Most High for<br />
the manifold blessings of the past year, consecrate themselves       <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
to a life of cleanliness, honor, and wisdom, so that<br />
this nation may do its allotted work on the earth in a<br />
manner worthy of those who founded it and of those who<br />
preserved it.<br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><br /><p>1. Keep a lookout for the current Thanksgiving Day
proclamation of the President. Read it with those
of Washington and Roosevelt, and contrast the
three, as to style of writing and historical facts
mentioned.</p></div>

<h2>THE CRATCHITS' CHRISTMAS</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Charles Dickens</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Old Scrooge was a rich and grasping business man;
Bob Cratchit was his underpaid and overworked
clerk. On Christmas Eve three spirits in succession
appeared to Scrooge: Christmas Past, Christmas
Present, and Christmas Yet-to-Come. The second
showed him, with other visions, this Christmas
feast in Cratchit's home. The lessons the spirits
taught him so influenced Scrooge that he set out
early next morning to spend a real Christmas; and
he was a changed man ever after.</p></div>


<p>
Then up rose Mrs. Cratchit, Cratchit's wife, dressed<br />
out but poorly in a twice-turned gown, but brave<br />
in ribbons, which are cheap and make a goodly show for<br />
sixpence; and she laid the cloth, assisted by Belinda<br />
Cratchit, second of her daughters, also brave in ribbons; <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
while Master Peter Cratchit plunged a fork into the saucepan<br />
of potatoes, and getting the corners of his monstrous<br />
shirt collar (Bob's private property, conferred upon his<br />
son and heir in honor of the day) into his mouth, rejoiced<br />
to find himself so gallantly attired and yearned to show his         <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
linen in the fashionable parks. And now two smaller<br />
Cratchits, boy and girl, came tearing in, screaming that<br />
outside the baker's they had smelt the goose and known it<br />
for their own; and basking in luxurious thoughts of sage<br />
and onion these young Cratchits danced about the table   <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
and exalted Master Peter Cratchit to the skies, while he<br />
(not proud, although his collars nearly choked him) blew<br />
the fire until the slow potatoes, bubbling up, knocked loudly<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>at the saucepan lid to be let out and peeled.<br />
</p><p>
"What has ever got your precious father, then?" said<br />
Mrs. Cratchit. "And your brother, Tiny Tim! And<br />
Martha warn't as late last Christmas Day by half an<br />
hour!"<br />
</p><p>
"Here's Martha, mother," said a girl, appearing as she    <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
spoke.<br />
</p><p>
"Here's Martha, mother!" cried the two young<br />
Cratchits. "Hurrah! There's such a goose, Martha!"<br />
</p><p>
"Why, bless your heart alive, my dear, how late you<br />
are!" said Mrs. Cratchit, kissing her a dozen times and  <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
taking off her shawl and bonnet for her with officious zeal.<br />
</p><p>
"We'd a deal of work to finish up last night," replied<br />
the girl, "and had to clear away this morning, mother!"<br />
</p><p>
"Well! never mind so long as you are come," said Mrs.<br />
Cratchit. "Sit ye down before the fire, my dear, and have<span class="linenum">15</span><br />
a warm, Lord bless ye!"<br />
</p><p>
"No, no! There's father coming," cried the two young<br />
Cratchits, who were everywhere at once. "Hide, Martha,<br />
hide!"<br />
</p><p>
So Martha hid herself, and in came little Bob, the father,           <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
with at least three feet of comforter, exclusive of the fringe,<br />
hanging down before him; and his threadbare clothes<br />
darned up and brushed, to look seasonable; and Tiny Tim<br />
upon his shoulder. Alas for Tiny Tim, he bore a little<br />
crutch and had his limbs supported by an iron frame!     <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
</p><p>
"Why, where's our Martha?" cried Bob Cratchit, looking<br />
round.<br />
</p><p>
"Not coming," said Mrs. Cratchit.<br />
</p><p>
"Not coming!" said Bob, with a sudden declension in<br />
his high spirits; for he had been Tim's blood horse all the          <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
way from church and had come home rampant. "Not<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>coming upon Christmas Day!"<br />
</p><p>
Martha didn't like to see him disappointed, if it were<br />
only a joke; so she came out prematurely from behind the<br />
closet door and ran into his arms, while the two young<br />
Cratchits hustled Tiny Tim and bore him off into the<br />
washhouse, that he might hear the pudding singing in the  <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
copper.<br />
</p><p>
"And how did little Tim behave?" asked Mrs. Cratchit,<br />
when she had rallied Bob on his credulity and Bob had<br />
hugged his daughter to his heart's content.<br />
</p><p>
"As good as gold," said Bob, "and better. Somehow he     <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
gets thoughtful, sitting by himself so much, and thinks<br />
the strangest things you ever heard. He told me, coming<br />
home, that he hoped the people saw him in the church,<br />
because he was a cripple and it might be pleasant to them<br />
to remember, upon Christmas Day, who made lame beggars   <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
walk and blind men see."<br />
</p><p>
Bob's voice was tremulous when he told them this, and<br />
trembled more when he said that Tiny Tim was growing<br />
strong and hearty.<br />
</p><p>
His active little crutch was heard upon the floor and    <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
back came Tiny Tim before another word was spoken,<br />
escorted by his brother and sister to his stool beside the<br />
fire; and while Bob, turning up his cuffs&mdash;as if, poor<br />
fellow, they were capable of being made more shabby&mdash;compounded<br />
some hot mixture in a jug with gin and lemons            <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
and stirred it round and round and put it on the hob to<br />
simmer, Master Peter and the two ubiquitous young<br />
Cratchits went to fetch the goose, with which they soon<br />
returned in high procession.<br />
</p><p>
Such a bustle ensued that you might have thought a       <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
goose the rarest of all birds; a feathered phenomenon, to<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>which a black swan was a matter of course&mdash;and in truth<br />
it was something very like it, in that house. Mrs. Cratchit<br />
made the gravy (ready beforehand in a little saucepan)<br />
hissing hot; Master Peter mashed the potatoes with incredible<br />
vigor; Miss Belinda sweetened up the apple sauce;<br />
Martha dusted the hot plates; Bob took Tiny Tim beside    <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
him in a tiny corner at the table; the two young Cratchits<br />
set chairs for everybody, not forgetting themselves, and<br />
mounting guard upon their posts, crammed spoons into<br />
their mouths lest they should shriek for goose before their<br />
turn came to be helped. At last the dishes were set on   <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
and grace was said. It was succeeded by a breathless<br />
pause, as Mrs. Cratchit, looking slowly all along the carving<br />
knife, prepared to plunge it in the breast; but when she<br />
did, and when the long-expected gush of stuffing issued<br />
forth, one murmur of delight arose all round the board,  <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
and even Tiny Tim, excited by the two young Cratchits,<br />
beat on the table with the handle of his knife and feebly<br />
cried, "Hurrah!"<br />
</p><p>
There never was such a goose cooked. Its tenderness<br />
and flavor, size and cheapness, were the themes of universal         <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
admiration. Eked out by apple sauce and mashed potatoes,<br />
it was a sufficient dinner for the whole family;<br />
indeed, as Mrs. Cratchit said with great delight (surveying<br />
one small atom of a bone upon the dish), they hadn't eaten<br />
it all at last! Yet everyone had had enough, and the     <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
youngest Cratchits, in particular, were steeped in sage and<br />
onion to the eyebrows! But now the plates being changed<br />
by Miss Belinda, Mrs. Cratchit left the room alone&mdash;too<br />
nervous to bear witnesses&mdash;to take the pudding up, and<br />
bring it in.                                             <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
</p><p>
Suppose it should not be done enough! Suppose it<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>should break in turning out! Suppose somebody should<br />
have got over the wall of the back yard and stolen it, while<br />
they were merry with the goose&mdash;a supposition at which<br />
the two young Cratchits became livid! All sorts of horrors<br />
were supposed.<br />
</p><p>
Halloo! A great deal of steam! The pudding was out        <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
of the copper. A smell like a washing day! That was the<br />
cloth. A smell like an eating house and a pastry cook's<br />
next door to each other, with a laundress's next door to<br />
that! That was the pudding! In half a minute Mrs.<br />
Cratchit entered&mdash;flushed, but smiling proudly&mdash;with     <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
the pudding, like a speckled cannon ball, so hard and<br />
firm, blazing in half of half a quartern of ignited brandy<br />
and bedight with Christmas holly stuck into the top.<br />
</p><p>
Oh, a wonderful pudding! Bob Cratchit said, and<br />
calmly too, that he regarded it as the greatest success  <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
achieved by Mrs. Cratchit since their marriage. Mrs.<br />
Cratchit said that now the weight was off her mind, she<br />
would confess she had had her doubts about the quantity<br />
of flour. Everybody had something to say about it, but<br />
nobody said or thought it was at all a small pudding for <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
a large family. It would have been flat heresy to do so.<br />
Any Cratchit would have blushed to hint at such a thing.<br />
</p><p>
At last the dinner was all done, the cloth was cleared, the<br />
hearth swept, and the fire made up. The compound in the<br />
jug being tasted and considered perfect, apples and oranges          <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
were put upon the table and a shovelful of chestnuts on the<br />
fire. Then all the Cratchit family drew round the hearth<br />
in what Bob Cratchit called a circle, meaning half a one;<br />
and at Bob Cratchit's elbow stood the family display of<br />
glass&mdash;two tumblers and a custard cup without a handle.  <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
</p><p>
These held the hot stuff from the jug, however, as well as<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>golden goblets would have done; and Bob served it out<br />
with beaming looks, while the chestnuts on the fire sputtered<br />
and cracked noisily. Then Bob proposed:<br />
</p><p>
"A Merry Christmas to us all, my dears. God bless us!"<br />
</p><p>
Which all the family re&euml;choed.<br />
</p><p>
"God bless us every one!" said Tiny Tim, the last of all. <span class="linenum">5</span><br />

<h2>THE HOLIDAY SPIRIT</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By &Eacute;mile Souvestre</span></h3>


<p>
Twelve o'clock.&mdash;A knock at my door; a poor<br />
girl comes in and greets me by name. At first I<br />
do not recall her, but she looks at me and smiles. Ah, it is<br />
Paulette! But it is nearly a year since I have seen her,<br />
and Paulette is no longer the same; the other day she was <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
a child; to-day she is almost a young woman.<br />
</p><p>
Paulette is thin, pale, and miserably clad; but she has<br />
always the same open and straightforward look&mdash;the same<br />
mouth, smiling at every word as if to plead for sympathy&mdash;the<br />
same voice, timid yet caressing. Paulette is not         <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
pretty&mdash;she is even thought plain; as for me, I think her<br />
charming. Perhaps that is not on her account but on my<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>own. Paulette is a part of one of my happiest recollections.<br />
</p><p>
It was the evening of a public holiday. Our principal<br />
buildings were lighted with festoons of fire, a thousand<br />
flags floated in the night wind, and the fireworks had just<br />
shot forth their jets of flame in the midst of the <i>Champ de<br />
Mars</i>. Suddenly one of those unaccountable panics which<span class="linenum">5</span><br />
seize a multitude falls upon the dense crowd; they cry out,<br />
they rush on headlong; the weaker ones fall and the<br />
frightened crowd tramples them down in its convulsive<br />
struggles. Escaping from the confusion by a miracle, I<br />
was hastening away when the cries of a perishing child   <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
arrested me; I went back into that human chaos and<br />
after unheard-of exertions I brought Paulette away at the<br />
peril of my life.<br />
</p><p>
That was two years ago; since then I had seen the child<br />
only at long intervals and had almost forgotten her; but <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
Paulette had a grateful heart, and she came at the beginning<br />
of the year to bring me her good wishes. She brought<br />
me, too, a wallflower in full bloom; she herself had planted<br />
and reared it; it was something that belonged wholly to<br />
herself, for it was because of her care, her perseverance,           <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
and her patience that it was hers.<br />
</p><p>
The wallflower had grown in a common pot; but Paulette,<br />
who is a bandbox maker, had put it into a case of<br />
varnished paper ornamented with arabesques. These<br />
might have been in better taste, but I felt the good will<span class="linenum">25</span><br />
none the less.<br />
</p><p>
This unexpected present, the little girl's modest blushes,<br />
the compliments she stammered out, dispelled, as by a<br />
sunbeam, the mist which had gathered round my heart;<br />
my thoughts suddenly changed from the leaden tints of    <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
evening to the rosiest colors of dawn. I made Paulette<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>sit down and questioned her with a light heart.<br />
</p><p>
At first the little girl replied by monosyllables; but<br />
very soon the tables were turned and it was I who interrupted<br />
with short interjections her long confidences. The<br />
poor child leads a hard life. She was left an orphan long<br />
ago and with a brother and sister lives with an old grandmother,      <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
who has <i>brought them up to poverty</i>, as she says.<br />
</p><p>
However Paulette now helps her to make bandboxes, her<br />
little sister Perrine begins to sew, and her brother Henri<br />
is apprenticed to a printer. All would go well if it were not<br />
for losses and want of work&mdash;if it were not for clothes which        <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
wear out, for appetites which grow larger, and for the<br />
winter, when you must buy your sunshine. Paulette complains<br />
that candles go too quickly and that the wood costs<br />
too much. The fireplace in their garret is so large that a<br />
fagot produces no more effect than a match; it is so near<span class="linenum">15</span><br />
the roof that the wind blows down the rain and in winter<br />
it hails upon the hearth; so they have given up using it.<br />
Henceforth they must be content with an earthen chafing<br />
dish, upon which they cook their meals. The grandmother<br />
had often spoken of a stove that was for sale at the huckster's      <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
on the ground floor, but he asked seven francs for it<br />
and the times are too hard for such an expense; the family,<br />
therefore, resign themselves to cold for economy's sake!<br />
</p><p>
As Paulette spoke I felt more and more that I was rising<br />
above my low spirits. The first disclosures of the little<span class="linenum">25</span><br />
bandbox maker created within me a wish that soon became<br />
a plan. I questioned her about her daily occupations and<br />
she told me that on leaving me she must go with her brother,<br />
her sister, and her grandmother, to the different people for<br />
whom they work. My plan was immediately settled. I       <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
told the child that I would go to see her in the evening,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>and I sent her away, thanking her anew.<br />
</p><p>
I placed the wallflower in the open window, where a ray<br />
of sunshine bade it welcome; the birds were singing around,<br />
the sky had cleared, and the day which began so gloomily<br />
had become bright. I sang as I moved about my room,<br />
and having hastily got ready I went out.                  <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
</p><p>
Three o'clock.&mdash;All is settled with my neighbor, the<br />
chimney doctor; he will repair my old stove, the old stove<br />
which I had replaced, and promises to make it as good as<br />
new. At five o'clock we are going to put it up in Paulette's<br />
grandmother's room.                                      <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
</p><p>
Midnight.&mdash;All has gone well. At the hour agreed<br />
upon I was at the old bandbox maker's; she was still out.<br />
My Piedmontese fixed the stove, while I arranged in the<br />
great fireplace a dozen logs borrowed from my winter's<br />
stock. I shall make up for them by warming myself with   <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
walking or by going to bed earlier.<br />
</p><p>
My heart beat at every step which was heard on the<br />
staircase; I trembled lest they should interrupt me in my<br />
preparations and should thus spoil my intended surprise.<br />
But no&mdash;everything is ready; the lighted stove murmurs   <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
gently, the little lamp burns upon the table, and a bottle<br />
of oil for it is provided on the shelf. The chimney doctor<br />
is gone. Now my fear lest they should come is changed<br />
into impatience at their delay. At last I hear children's<br />
voices; here they are! They push open the door and       <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
rush in&mdash;but they stop with cries of astonishment.<br />
</p><p>
At sight of the lamp, the stove, and the visitor who<br />
stands there like a magician in the midst of these wonders,<br />
they draw back almost frightened. Paulette is the first to<br />
understand, and the arrival of the grandmother, mounting <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
the stairs more slowly, finishes the explanation. Then come<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>tears, ecstasies, thanks!<br />
</p><p>
Surprises are not over yet. The little sister opens the<br />
oven and discovers some chestnuts just roasted; the<br />
grandmother puts her hand on the bottles of cider arranged<br />
on the dresser; and I draw forth from the basket that I<br />
have hidden, a cold tongue, a wedge-shaped piece of butter,           <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
and some fresh rolls.<br />
</p><p>
Now their wonder turns into admiration; the little family<br />
have never taken part in such a feast! They lay the cloth,<br />
they sit down, they eat; it is a perfect festival for all, and<br />
each contributes his share. I had brought only the supper;           <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
the bandbox maker and the children supplied the enjoyment.<br />
</p><p>
What bursts of laughter at nothing! What a hubbub of<br />
questions which waited for no reply, of replies which answered<br />
no question! The old woman herself shared in the<br />
wild merriment of the little ones! I have always wondered<span class="linenum">15</span><br />
at the ease with which the poor forget their wretchedness.<br />
Accustomed to live in the present, they use every pleasure<br />
as soon as it offers itself. But the rich, blunted by luxury,<br />
gain happiness less easily. They must have all things in<br />
harmony before they consent to be happy.                 <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
</p><p>
The evening passed like a moment. The old woman has<br />
told me the story of her life, sometimes smiling, sometimes<br />
crying. Perrine has sung an old ballad with her<br />
fresh young voice. Henri has told us what he knows of<br />
the great writers of the day, whose proofs he has to carry.          <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
At last we were obliged to separate, not without new<br />
thanks on the part of the happy family.<br />
</p><p>
I have come home slowly, with a full heart, thinking<br />
over the pure memories of this evening. It has given me<br />
comfort and much instruction. Now the years can come     <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
and go. I know that no one is so unhappy as to have<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>nothing to receive and nothing to give.<br />
</p><p>
As I came in I met my rich neighbor's new equipage.<br />
She too had just returned from her evening party; and as<br />
she sprang from the carriage step with feverish impatience,<br />
I heard her murmur, "<i>At last!</i>"<br />
</p><p>
I, when I left Paulette's family, said, "<i>So soon!</i>" <span class="linenum">5</span><br />

<h2>CHRISTMAS IN THE PINES</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Meredith Nicholson</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Here is a Christmas story of the northland, in
which cities give way to pine woods, and people to
silences and snow. Get the picture each stanza
portrays as you read through the poem, and make a
mental comparison with snow scenes with which you
are familiar.</p></div>


<div>
The sky was clear all yesterday,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From dawn until the sunset's flame;</span><br />
But when the red had grown to gray,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Out of the west the snow clouds came.</span><br />
<br />
At midnight by the dying fire,                            <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Watching the spruce boughs glow and pale,</span><br />
I heard outside a tumult dire,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the fierce roaring of the gale.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span><br />
Now with the morning comes a lull;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sun shines boldly in the east</span><br />
Upon a world made beautiful<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In vesture for the Christmas feast.</span><br />
<br />
Into the pathless waste I go,                             <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With muffled step among the pines</span><br />
That, robed in sunlight and soft snow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Stand like a thousand radiant shrines.</span><br />
<br />
Save for a lad's song, far and faint,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There is no sound in all the wood; <span class="linenum">10</span></span><br />
The murmuring pines are still; their plaint<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At last was heard and understood.</span><br />
<br />
Here floats no chime of Christmas bell,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There is no voice to give me cheer;</span><br />
But through the pine wood all is well,                   <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For God and love and peace are here.</span><br />

<h2>THE NEW YEAR'S DINNER PARTY</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Charles Lamb</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The following essay is a humorous treatment of the
days of the year, with emphasis on the holidays and
special days in the English calendar. You should
read it with a sharp lookout for the play on words.
Each day supposedly acts in keeping with its
character, and so the New Year's dinner party is
kept in high mirth. But you cannot appreciate the
humor until you understand what each day stands
for.</p></div>


<p>
The Old Year being dead, the New Year came of age,<br />
which he does by Calendar Law as soon as the breath<br />
is out of the old gentleman's body. Nothing would serve<br />
the youth but he must give a dinner upon the occasion, to<br />
which all the Days of the Year were invited.              <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
</p><p>
The Festivals, whom he appointed as his stewards, were<br />
mightily taken with the notion. They had been engaged<br />
time out of mind, they said, in providing mirth and cheer<br />
for mortals below; and it was time that they should have<br />
a taste of their bounty.                                 <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
</p><p>
All the Days came to dinner. Covers were provided for<br />
three hundred and sixty-five guests at the principal table,<br />
with an occasional knife and fork at the sideboard for the<br />
Twenty-ninth of February.<br />
</p><p>
I should have told you that invitations had been sent out.           <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
The carriers were the Hours&mdash;twelve as merry little whirligig<br />
foot pages as you should desire to see. They went all<br />
around, and found out the persons invited well enough,<br />
with the exception of Easter Day, Shrove Tuesday, and a<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>few such Movables, who had lately shifted their quarters.<span class="linenum">20</span><br />
</p><p>
Well, they were all met at last, four Days, five Days, all<br />
sorts of Days, and a rare din they made of it. There was<br />
nothing but "Hail! fellow Day!" "Well met, brother<br />
Day! sister Day!"&mdash;only Lady Day kept a little on the<br />
aloof and seemed somewhat scornful. Yet some said that    <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
Twelfth Day cut her out, for she came in a silk suit, white<br />
and gold, like a queen on a frost cake, all royal and<br />
glittering.<br />
</p><p>
The rest came, some in green, some in white&mdash;but Lent<br />
and his family were not yet out of mourning. Rainy Days  <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
came in dripping, and Sunshiny Days helped them to<br />
change their stockings. Wedding Day was there in his<br />
marriage finery. Pay Day came late, as he always does.<br />
Doomsday sent word he might be expected.<br />
</p><p>
April Fool (as my lord's jester) took upon himself to    <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
marshal the guests. And wild work he made of it; good<br />
Days, bad Days, all were shuffled together. He had stuck<br />
the Twenty-first of June next to the Twenty-second of<br />
December, and the former looked like a maypole by the side<br />
of a marrowbone. Ash Wednesday got wedged in betwixt     <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
Christmas and Lord Mayor's Day.<br />
</p><p>
At another part of the table, Shrove Tuesday was helping<br />
the Second of September to some broth, which courtesy<br />
the latter returned with the delicate thigh of a pheasant.<br />
The Last of Lent was springing upon Shrovetide's pancakes;           <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
April Fool, seeing this, told him that he did well, for pancakes<br />
were proper to a good fry-day.<br />
</p><p>
May Day, with that sweetness which is her own, made a<br />
neat speech proposing the health of the founder. This<br />
being done, the lordly New Year from the upper end of    <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
the table, in a cordial but somewhat lofty tone, returned<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>thanks.<br />
</p><p>
They next fell to quibbles and conundrums. The question<br />
being proposed, who had the greatest number of followers&mdash;the<br />
Quarter Days said there could be no question<br />
as to that; for they had all the creditors in the world<br />
dogging their heels. But April Fool gave it in favor of the           <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
Forty Days before Easter; because the debtors in all cases<br />
outnumbered the creditors, and they kept Lent all the year.<br />
</p><p>
At last, dinner being ended, all the Days called for<br />
their cloaks and greatcoats, and took their leaves. Lord<br />
Mayor's Day went off in a Mist, as usual; Shortest Day   <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
in a deep black Fog, which wrapped the little gentleman<br />
all round like a hedgehog.<br />
</p><p>
Two Vigils, or watchmen, saw Christmas Day safe home.<br />
Another Vigil&mdash;a stout, sturdy patrol, called the Eve of<br />
St. Christopher&mdash;escorted Ash Wednesday.                 <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
</p><p>
Longest Day set off westward in beautiful crimson and<br />
gold&mdash;the rest, some in one fashion some in another, took<br />
their departure.<br />
</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">&mdash;<i>Last Essays of Elia.</i></span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><br /><p>1. Lord Mayor's Day falls on November 9. Explain
the reference to Mist. Quarter Day is the day
usually looked upon as the day rent falls due. Why
did April Fool decide against the Quarter Days in
behalf of the Forty Days before Easter? The Second
of September is the beginning of the open season
for shooting. Explain the reference to "pheasant."</p>

<p>2. How many were at this feast? Why did the
Festivals come? Why have only twelve carriers, in
the fourth paragraph? Explain how April Fool added
to the merriment in seating the guests. What pun
did April Fool make?</p>

<p>3. What American holidays would you add if you were
writing this essay? How could you make them fit in
humorously?</p>

<h2>AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN</h2>

<h3>(<span class="smcap">Written for Jesse W. Fell</span>, December 20, 1859)</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Abraham Lincoln enjoyed telling stories of his
youth and early manhood, but he wrote very little
about himself. The following is the longest
statement he has set down anywhere about his own
life. And he did this only at the earnest request
of a fellow citizen in Illinois, Mr. Fell. You
should read this brief autobiography with two
things in mind: the facts of Lincoln's life, and
the simplicity and modesty of the statement of
these facts.</p></div>


<p>
I was born February 12, 1809, in Hardin County, Kentucky.<br />
My parents were both born in Virginia, of<br />
undistinguished families&mdash;second families, perhaps I<br />
should say. My mother, who died in my tenth year, was<br />
of a family of the name of Hanks, some of whom now reside <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
in Adams, and others in Macon County, Illinois. My<br />
paternal grandfather, Abraham Lincoln, emigrated from<br />
Rockingham County, Virginia, to Kentucky about 1781<br />
or 1782, where a year or two later he was killed by the<br />
Indians, not in battle, but by stealth, when he was laboring         <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
to open a farm in the forest. His ancestors, who were<br />
Quakers, went to Virginia from Berks County, Pennsylvania.<br />
An effort to identify them with the New England<br />
family of the same name ended in nothing more definite<br />
than a similarity of Christian names in both families, such          <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
as Enoch, Levi, Mordecai, Solomon, Abraham, and the like.<br />
</p><p>
My father, at the death of his father, was but six years of<br />
age, and he grew up literally without education. He removed<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>from Kentucky to what is now Spencer County,<br />
Indiana, in my eighth year. We reached our new home<br />
about the time the state came into the Union. It was a<br />
wild region, with many bears and other wild animals still<br />
in the woods. There I grew up. There were some schools,<br />
so called, but no qualification was ever required of a teacher        <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
beyond "readin', writin', and cipherin'" to the rule of three.<br />
If a straggler supposed to understand Latin happened to<br />
sojourn in the neighborhood, he was looked upon as a<br />
wizard. There was absolutely nothing to excite ambition<br />
for education. Of course, when I came of age I did not   <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
know much. Still, somehow, I could read, write, and<br />
cipher to the rule of three, but that was all. I have not<br />
been to school since. The little advance I now have upon<br />
this store of education I have picked up from time to time<br />
under the pressure of necessity.                         <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
</p><p>
I was raised to farm work, which I continued till I was<br />
twenty-two. At twenty-one I came to Illinois, Macon<br />
County. Then I got to New Salem, at that time in Sangamon,<br />
now in Menard County, where I remained a year as a<br />
sort of clerk in a store.                                <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
</p><p>
Then came the Black Hawk war, and I was elected a captain<br />
of volunteers, a success which gave me more pleasure<br />
than any I have had since. I went the campaign, was<br />
elated, ran for the legislature the same year (1832), and was<br />
beaten&mdash;the only time I have ever been beaten by the     <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
people. The next and three succeeding biennial elections<br />
I was elected to the legislature. I was not a candidate<br />
afterward. During this legislative period I had studied<br />
law, and removed to Springfield to practice it. In 1846 I<br />
was once elected to the lower house of Congress. Was     <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
not a candidate for re&euml;lection. From 1849 to 1854, both<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>inclusive, practiced law more assiduously than ever before.<br />
Always Whig in politics; and generally on the Whig<br />
electoral tickets, making active canvasses. I was losing<br />
interest in politics when the repeal of the Missouri Compromise<br />
aroused me again. What I have done since then<br />
is pretty well known.                                     <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
</p><p>
If any personal description of me is thought desirable,<br />
it may be said I am, in height, six feet four inches, nearly;<br />
lean in flesh, weighing on an average one hundred and<br />
eighty pounds; dark complexion, with coarse black hair<br />
and gray eyes. No other marks or brands recollected.     <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><br /><p>1. Outline Lincoln's life, ancestry, etc., as here
presented, under the proper heads. Test your
outline by trying to group all the facts under
their proper headings. This will require careful
re-reading of the selection.</p>

<p>2. Next take one of your topics and practice
<i>thinking</i> of the items you have included under it.
Be ready to speak on any one of your topics at
class recitation.</p>

<p>3. What major events of Lincoln's life are omitted
from this document? Why? (To answer this, refer to
your history for the dates of Lincoln's presidency;
compare with the date when this was written.)</p>

<p>4. Is there anything in the article that sounds the
least boastful? Explain lines 25-26 in this
connection.</p>

<p>5. Who were the Whigs? What was the Missouri
Compromise?</p>

<p>6. One sentence in this suggests the sly humor of
Lincoln. Find it.</p></div>

<h2>O CAPTAIN! MY CAPTAIN</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Walt Whitman</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Civil War between the North and the South
lasted from 1861-1865. Abraham Lincoln was
President of the United States at the time, and it
was largely due to his wisdom that the great
conflict lasted no longer. The Northern armies were
generally victorious in the winter and spring of
1865. The nation, however, was suddenly bowed in
grief. The President was shot by an assassin on
April 14, and died next day.</p>

<p>Walt Whitman (1819-1892) at the time was employed
in a clerical position in the War Department, and,
outside office hours, in nursing wounded soldiers
in Washington. He often saw Lincoln, who passed
Whitman's house almost every day. The "Good Gray
Poet" and the President had a bowing acquaintance;
and in one of his books Whitman refers to the
dark-brown face, deep-cut lines, and sad eyes of
Lincoln. Whitman gave expression to his grief at
the country's loss in the following poem, in which
he refers to the martyred President as the captain
of the Ship of State.</p></div>


<div>
O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,<br />
The ship has weathered every rack, the prize we<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">sought is won;</span><br />
The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,<br />
While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and    <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">daring;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">But O heart! heart! heart!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">O the bleeding drops of red,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Where on the deck my Captain lies,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Fallen cold and dead. <span class="linenum">10</span></span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span><br />
O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;<br />
Rise up&mdash;for you the flag is flung&mdash;for you the bugle<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">trills,</span><br />
For you bouquets and ribboned wreaths&mdash;for you the<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">shores a-crowding.&nbsp; </span><span class="linenum">5</span><br />
For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">turning.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Here, Captain! dear father!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">This arm beneath your head!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">It is some dream that on the deck</span><span class="linenum">10</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">You've fallen cold and dead.</span><br />
<br />
My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,<br />
My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will;<br />
The ship is anchored safe and sound, its voyage closed and<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">done,</span> <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Exult, O shores, and ring, O bells!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">But I, with mournful tread,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Walk the deck my Captain lies,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Fallen cold and dead.</span> <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 15em;">&mdash;<i>Drum Taps.</i></span><br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><br /><p>1. Explain the references to the safe arrival of
the ship in port, the ringing of the bells, and the
general exultation.</p>

<p>2. Re-read the poem carefully. Picture to yourself
what each stanza contributes as you read. When you
have finished, test yourself to see how much of it
you can recall exactly. Complete the memorization
by this same process of careful re-reading.</p>

<p>3. Whitman had his volume, <i>Drum Taps</i>, practically
completed when Lincoln's assassination <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'occured'">occurred</ins>. He
held up its publication to include "O Captain! My
Captain" and another poem on the death of Lincoln,
called "When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloomed."
Why is the title of the latter poem appropriate?</p></div>

<h2>WASHINGTON'S GREATEST BATTLE</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Frederick Trevor Hill</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>By 1781 the French were co&ouml;perating with our
colonial troops against the armies and navies of
the British. Lafayette was in the South helping
Greene worry Cornwallis. Rochambeau was working
with Washington near New York, to keep Clinton from
uniting his forces with those of Cornwallis. De
Grasse, in charge of the French fleet, was planning
a blow at the British squadron. The stage was thus
set for a great military stroke&mdash;and Washington
readily took up the cue.</p></div>


<p>
Word was received from Lafayette that Cornwallis<br />
had moved to Yorktown on the York River, Virginia,<br />
close to Chesapeake Bay, and almost at the same<br />
moment the long-expected dispatch arrived from de Grasse,<br />
advising Washington that he was just on the point of      <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
sailing for Chesapeake Bay. The instant he received this<br />
news the American commander realized that his chance had<br />
come. Cornwallis had evidently brought his army to<br />
Yorktown that it might co&ouml;perate with a British fleet in<br />
the Chesapeake, and by good luck de Grasse was heading   <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
directly for this very spot. A bold, swift stroke might now<br />
end the war, and the plan which Washington immediately<br />
put in operation was daring to a really perilous degree.<br />
</p><p>
Up to this point all the movements of the French and<br />
Americans had convinced Clinton that an attack would     <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
soon be made against New York. Never for a moment did<br />
he imagine that his opponent would dare leave the Hudson<br />
unguarded and throw his whole army against Cornwallis.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>The risk of losing West Point and the difficulty of covering<br />
the hundreds of miles that lay between New York and Yorktown<br />
seemed to forbid any such maneuver. Nevertheless,<br />
this was precisely what Washington intended to do, and<br />
within a few days after the receipt of de Grasse's message<br />
he was hurrying southward with every man he could         <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
possibly spare.<br />
</p><p>
Secrecy and speed were essential to success, for if Clinton<br />
discovered what was happening, he would undoubtedly<br />
try to throw his army between Cornwallis and the Americans,<br />
and even though he failed in stopping them he could      <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
easily delay their march until the British force at Yorktown<br />
had time to escape. Washington, therefore, took extraordinary<br />
care to conceal his plans, not only from his foes<br />
but also from his friends. Indeed, Rochambeau was the<br />
only officer who knew where the men were being headed as <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
they hurried through New Jersey, and so cleverly was their<br />
route selected that even when Clinton learned of their<br />
march he still believed that the Americans, having failed<br />
in the attempt on his rear door near King's Bridge, were<br />
about to swing around and try to get in at the front door<span class="linenum">20</span><br />
from Staten Island or Sandy Hook.<br />
</p><p>
This was just what Washington wanted him to think,<br />
and to deceive him still further, camp kitchens were erected<br />
along the expected line of march and the troops were so<br />
handled that they seemed to be moving straight to an     <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
attack on New York. But at the proper moment they were<br />
suddenly turned southward at a pace that defied pursuit,<br />
and before the true situation dawned on the British commander<br />
they were almost at the Delaware River. But<br />
though he had by this time acquired a fairly safe lead,  <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
Washington did not slacken his speed, and with a roar of<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>cheers from the now excited populace, the dusty columns<br />
were soon pouring through Philadelphia, the American<br />
commander pushing on ahead to Chester, and sending back<br />
word that de Grasse had arrived in Chesapeake Bay and<br />
that not a moment must be lost.<br />
</p><p>
Clinton then made a frantic effort to save the day by     <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
sending Arnold to attack some of the New England towns,<br />
thinking that the American commander might hurry back<br />
to their rescue. But Washington was first and foremost a<br />
man of good, hard common sense, and he knew that all<br />
Arnold could accomplish would be the destruction of a few<span class="linenum">10</span><br />
defenseless towns, and to let Cornwallis escape in order to<br />
protect them did not appeal to his practical mind at all.<br />
He therefore paid no attention to the traitor's movements,<br />
but bent all his efforts on speeding his army southward.<br />
</p><p>
At Chesapeake Bay an exasperating delay occurred, for    <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
there were not sufficient vessels to transport the army over<br />
the water, and for a time the success of the whole expedition<br />
was threatened. But Washington was in no mood to be<br />
blocked by obstacles of this sort. If his troops could not<br />
be ferried down the bay, they must march around it, and  <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
march many of them did, their general obtaining the first<br />
glimpse he had had in six years of his beloved Mount<br />
Vernon as he swept by, and on September 28, 1781, his<br />
whole force was in front of Yorktown, with success fairly<br />
within its grasp.                                        <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
</p><p>
Meanwhile de Grasse's fleet had fiercely assailed a British<br />
squadron which had been sent to the rescue, and after a<br />
sharp engagement the French had been able to return to<br />
the bay while the British vessels were obliged to retire to<br />
New York, leaving Cornwallis with the York River on one  <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
side of him, the James River on the other, and the Chesapeake<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>Bay at his back, but no ships to carry him to safety.<br />
Only one chance of escape now remained, and that was to<br />
hurl his whole army through the narrow neck of land immediately<br />
in front of him and beat a hasty retreat to the south.<br />
But Washington had anticipated this desperate move by<br />
positive instructions to Lafayette, and acting upon them the          <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
young marquis rushed a body of French troops from the<br />
fleet into the gap, and the arrival of the American army<br />
completely blocked it.<br />
</p><p>
But, though the enemy was now in his clutch, Washington<br />
lost no time in tightening his hold, for de Grasse       <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
declared that his orders would not allow him to tarry much<br />
longer in the Chesapeake, and the failure of the other<br />
attempts to work with the French warned him to take no<br />
risks on this occasion.<br />
</p><p>
He therefore instantly set the troops at work with pickaxes          <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
and shovels throwing up intrenchments, behind which<br />
they crept nearer and nearer the imprisoned garrison, and<br />
he kept them at their tasks night and day, supervising<br />
every detail of the siege and organizing the labor with such<br />
method that not a second of time nor an ounce of strength<span class="linenum">20</span><br />
was wasted.<br />
</p><p>
Finally, on October 14th&mdash;just sixteen days after the<br />
combined armies had arrived on the scene&mdash;the commander<br />
in chief determined to hurry matters still further<br />
by carrying two of the enemy's outer works by assault, and           <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
Hamilton was assigned to lead the Americans and Colonel<br />
de Deuxponts the French. A brilliant charge followed,<br />
and Washington and Rochambeau, closely watching the<br />
movement, saw the Americans scale one of the redoubts<br />
and capture it within ten minutes, while the French soon <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
followed with equal success. From these two commanding<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>positions a perfect storm of shot and shell was then loosed<br />
against the British fortifications, but still Cornwallis<br />
would not yield.<br />
</p><p>
Indeed, he made an heroic attempt to break through the<br />
lines on the following night, and actually succeeded in<br />
spiking some of the French cannon before he was driven    <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
back; and again on the next night he made a desperate<br />
effort to escape by water, only to be foiled by a terrific<br />
storm. By this time, however, his defenses were practically<br />
battered to the ground and the town behind them was<br />
tumbling to pieces beneath the fire of more than fifty guns.         <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
</p><p>
In the face of this terrific bombardment further resistance<br />
was useless, and at ten o'clock on the morning of October<br />
17, 1781, exactly four years after the surrender of Burgoyne,<br />
a red-coated drummer boy mounted on the crumbling<br />
ramparts and beside him appeared an officer with a white <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
flag. Instantly the firing ceased, and an American officer<br />
approaching, the flag bearer was blindfolded and conducted<br />
to Washington. The message he bore was a proposition<br />
for surrender and a request that hostilities be<br />
suspended for twenty-four hours. But to this Washington  <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
would not consent. Two hours was all he would grant<br />
for arranging the terms of surrender. To this Cornwallis<br />
yielded, but his first propositions were promptly rejected<br />
by Washington, and it was not until eleven at night that<br />
all the details were finally agreed upon, and Cornwallis,<span class="linenum">25</span><br />
with over eight thousand officers and men, became prisoners<br />
of war.<br />
</p><p>
Two days later the British marched from their intrenchments,<br />
their bands playing a quaint old English tune, called<br />
<i>The World Turned Upside Down</i>, and, passing between<span class="linenum">30</span><br />
the French and American troops drawn up in line to receive<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>them, laid down their arms. At the head of the<br />
victorious columns rode Washington, Hamilton, Knox,<br />
Steuben, Lafayette, Rochambeau, Lincoln, and many other<br />
officers, but the British commander, being ill, was not<br />
present in person, and when his representative, General<br />
O'Hara, tendered his superior's sword to Washington, the  <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
commander in chief allowed General Lincoln, who had<br />
once been Cornwallis's prisoner, to receive it, and that<br />
officer, merely taking it in his hand for a moment, instantly<br />
returned it.<br />
</p><p>
Meanwhile horsemen were flying in all directions with    <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
the joyful tidings, and within a week the whole country was<br />
blazing with enthusiasm, while Washington was calmly<br />
planning to finish the work to which he had set his hand.<br />

<h2>JOHN JAMES AUDUBON</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By W. F. Markwick and W. A. Smith</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Our birds and our trees are often honored together
on a Bird and Arbor Day. The names of many
naturalists might be selected, whose biographies
could fittingly be read on such an occasion; but
none could be more appropriately chosen than that
of John James Audubon, the American pioneer among
the scientist lovers of both birds and trees.</p></div>


<p>
In 1828 a wonderful book, <i>The Birds of America</i>, by John<br />
James Audubon, was issued. It is a good illustration<br />
of what has been accomplished by beginning in one's youth<br />
to use the powers of observation. Audubon loved and<br />
studied birds. Even in his infancy, lying under the orange<span class="linenum">5</span><br />
trees on his father's plantation in Louisiana, he listened to<br />
the mocking-bird's song, watching and observing every<br />
motion as it flitted from bough to bough. When he was<br />
older he began to sketch every bird that he saw, and soon<br />
showed so much talent that he was taken to France to be  <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
educated.<br />
</p><p>
He entered cheerfully and earnestly upon his studies,<br />
and more than a year was devoted to mathematics; but<br />
whenever it was possible he rambled about the country,<br />
using his eyes and fingers, collecting more specimens, and           <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
sketching with such assiduity that when he left France,<br />
only seventeen years old, he had finished two hundred<br />
drawings of French birds. At this period he tells us that<br />
"it was not the desire of fame which prompted to this<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>devotion; it was simply the enjoyment of nature."        <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
</p><p>
A story is told of his lying on his back in the woods with<br />
some moss for his pillow and looking through a telescopic<br />
microscope day after day, to watch a pair of little birds<br />
while they made their nest. Their peculiar gray plumage<br />
harmonized with the color of the bark of the tree, so that it         <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
was impossible to see the birds except by the most careful<br />
observation. After three weeks of such patient labor,<br />
he felt that he had been amply rewarded for the toil and<br />
sacrifice by the results he had obtained.<br />
</p><p>
His power of observation gave him great happiness, from  <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
the time he rambled as a boy in the country in search of<br />
treasures of natural history, till, in his old age, he rose with<br />
the sun and went straightway to the woods near his home,<br />
enjoying still the beauties and wonders of nature. His<br />
strength of purpose and unwearied energy, combined with  <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
his pure enthusiasm, made him successful in his work as a<br />
naturalist; but it was all dependent on the habit formed<br />
in his boyhood&mdash;this habit of close and careful observation;<br />
and he not only had this habit of using his eyes but<br />
he looked at and studied things worth seeing, worth      <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
remembering.<br />
</p><p>
This brief sketch of Audubon's boyhood shows the predominant<br />
traits of his character&mdash;his power of observation,<br />
the training of the eye and hand&mdash;that made him in manhood<br />
"the most distinguished of American ornithologists,"     <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
with so much scientific ardor and perseverance that no expedition<br />
seemed dangerous or solitude inaccessible when<br />
he was engaged in his favorite study.<br />
</p><p>
He has left behind him, as the result of his labors, his<br />
great book, <i>The Birds of America</i>, in ten volumes, and         <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
illustrated with four hundred and forty-eight colored plates<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>of over one thousand species of birds, all drawn by his own<br />
hand, and each bird represented in its natural size; also a<br />
<i>Biography of American Birds</i>, in five large volumes, in<br />
which he describes their habits and customs. He was<br />
associated with Dr. Bachman, of Philadelphia, in the preparation<br />
of a work on <i>The Quadrupeds of America</i>, in six     <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
large volumes, the drawings for which were made by his<br />
two sons; and later on he published his <i>Biography of American<br />
Quadrupeds</i>, a work similar to the <i>Biography of American<br />
Birds</i>. He died at what is known as Audubon Park,<br />
on the Hudson, now within the limits of New York city, in<span class="linenum">10</span><br />
1851, at the age of seventy.<br />
</p>

<h2>MEMORIAL DAY, 1917</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Woodrow Wilson</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Spoken at Arlington to the veterans of the Federal
and Confederate armies. There were present men in
khaki soon to carry the spirit of America to the
battlefields of France.</p></div>


<p>
Any Memorial Day of this sort is, of course, a day touched<br />
with sorrowful memory, and yet I for one do not see<br />
how we can have any thought of pity for the men whose<br />
memory we honor to-day. I do not pity them. I envy<br />
them, rather, because theirs is a great work for liberty  <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
accomplished and we are in the midst of a work unfinished,<br />
testing our strength where their strength already has been<br />
tested. There is a touch of sorrow, but there is a touch<br />
of reassurance also in a day like this, because we know<br />
how the men of America have responded to the call of the <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
cause of liberty, and it fills our minds with a perfect assurance<br />
that that response will come again in equal measure,<br />
with equal majesty, and with a result which will hold the<br />
attention of all mankind.<br />
</p><p>
When you reflect upon it, these men who died to preserve <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
the Union died to preserve the instrument which we are<br />
now using to serve the world&mdash;a free nation espousing<br />
the cause of human liberty. In one sense that great<br />
struggle into which we have now entered is an American<br />
struggle, because it is in defense of American honor and <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
American rights, but it is something even greater than<br />
that; it is a world struggle. It is a struggle of men who<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>love liberty everywhere and in this cause America will<br />
show herself greater than ever because she will rise to a<br />
greater thing.<br />
</p><p>
We have said in the beginning that we planned this<br />
great government that men who wish freedom might have<br />
a place of refuge and a place where their hope could be   <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
realized, and now, having established such a government,<br />
having preserved such a government, having vindicated<br />
the power of such a government, we are saying to all mankind,<br />
"We did not set this government up in order that<br />
we might have a selfish and separate liberty, for we are <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
now ready to come to your assistance and fight out upon<br />
the fields of the world the cause of human liberty." In<br />
this thing America attains her full dignity and the full<br />
fruition of her great purpose.<br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><br /><p>1. During the World War, President Woodrow Wilson
(1856- ) delivered several notable speeches. In
fact, his ability to phrase a thought neatly,
caused Europe to look upon him as the spokesman of
the Allied cause. This extract from his speech in
the cemetery at Arlington, Va., is a good example
of his finished literary style. Compare it with
Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. How are the two
alike? How different?</p>

<p>2. How long before the delivery of this speech did
the United States declare war against Germany? What

<h2>A GRANDSTAND SEAT IN THE SKY</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Howard Mingos</span></h3>


<p>
"I don't know whether we can make it or not," said<br />
the pilot. "There's a forty-mile-an-hour wind up<br />
aloft, and we're going straight in the teeth of it. Maybe<br />
we'll have to turn back."<br />
</p><p>
But we did not turn back, and at times before we had      <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
covered the twenty-two miles separating New York from<br />
the army's Hazlehurst Field at Mineola, Long Island, I<br />
wished that we might turn round, if only for an instant, that<br />
I might adjust the fur-lined chin strap, the buckle of which<br />
snapped against my left ear with maddening persistency.  <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
</p><p>
A half dozen times, perhaps, I had raised my left hand<br />
carefully, only to have it flapped back at me as if I were<br />
slapping myself in the face. For we were in the pilot's seat<br />
of America's largest bombing plane, grandstand seats<br />
with nothing between us and the show but air, of which   <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
there was a plenty.<br />
</p><p>
Captain Roy N. Francis, one of the best-known American<br />
pilots, had cautioned me against sticking out my arm<br />
or hand, because of the nine-foot propeller whirling alongside<br />
of me, and its tips fanned my elbow just two thousand    <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
times a minute as I huddled in the seat with Francis to<br />
afford him more room.<br />
</p><p>
You understand I wanted to make myself as small as<br />
possible, so that he might have more space in which to<br />
operate the controls. I had every reason to believe they <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>required minute attention if we were to remain rebounding<br />
about the skies from wind pocket to wind pocket five<br />
thousand feet above the flying field. I had forgotten our<br />
objective, which was Manhattan&mdash;the dreams of fifteen<br />
years about to be realized.<br />
</p><p>
I particularly wanted to be ricocheting from the crest    <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
of one air wave to another. It was the choice of alternatives,<br />
I concluded, for below us the crazy-quilted landscape<br />
of Long Island appeared to be anything but a soft<br />
place for landing. And there was a barn directly under<br />
us for several minutes&mdash;the same barn. I know it was a   <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
barn because it had a fence around it; otherwise it might<br />
have been a dog's kennel&mdash;a lone dog's kennel at that&mdash;so<br />
tiny was it from our viewpoint.<br />
</p><p>
I know we hung suspended over it for some time. I<br />
had an opportunity to review my entire past life, my good<span class="linenum">15</span><br />
deeds, of which there were few that I could recall at the<br />
moment, and my misdeeds, of which there were many.<br />
I pondered if they would miss me at the office. I thought<br />
of other offices and other fellows and the nature of their<br />
retrospection, fellows who had been in positions similar <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
to mine&mdash;and I knew where they were, or rather, where<br />
they were not.<br />
</p><p>
Francis had pointed at me among four other prospective<br />
passengers standing about the great plane while they tuned<br />
up the motors.                                           <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
</p><p>
"You there, little fellow, get in here beside me!"<br />
</p><p>
I had shinnied up the stepladder and crawled in beside<br />
him, flattered at the distinction&mdash;the others took their<br />
places in other cockpits free from controls and instruments&mdash;and<br />
then I understood the reason for his choice.             <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
</p><p>
Our flying suits were lined with fur, and bulky. The<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>cockpit was narrow at best, and Francis is not a small man.<br />
So I huddled as far as possible at the side of the flyer's seat,<br />
my side of it. And then: "Keep your paws in, if you<br />
don't want them taken off with that propeller," he had<br />
shouted into my ear. "Sit tight!"<br />
</p><p>
I sat tight. No shrimp ever had as many wrinkles as I.    <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
I pulled my hand in a fraction of an inch, braced my legs<br />
against nothing in particular, while my back assumed the<br />
characteristics of a concertina, closed.<br />
</p><p>
He had thrown back the throttle. There was a blast<br />
and a roar. I had the same lonesome feeling in the pit of my         <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
stomach that had seized me when I first took the express<br />
elevator in the Woolworth Building.<br />
</p><p>
It occurred to me to win the respect of the pilot by appearing<br />
confident. So I forced myself to peer over the side.<br />
The earth was dropping away so fast that it all seemed   <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
like a nightmare. I felt as if I had been dreaming and had<br />
fallen out of bed.<br />
</p><p>
"Grin at him," something told me. I grinned.<br />
</p><p>
A dozen or more icicles immediately crunched between<br />
my teeth, pierced the roof of my mouth, and froze my     <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
brain, while leaden drops of water percolated through it<br />
and trickled down my spine.<br />
</p><p>
"Keep grinning!" that unconscious self put in again.<br />
The advice was useless. I couldn't have closed my mouth<br />
had I wanted to. Finally by bowing my head I shut my     <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
jaws. Oh, for that chin strap which was whacking my<br />
face! It would have kept me warm. Despite the heat<br />
through which we had traveled in reaching Hazlehurst<br />
Field that morning, up here, a mile high, the air was cold.<br />
</p><p>
I stole a sidelong glance at Francis from behind the     <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
heavy goggles which some friendly stranger had fitted over<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>my helmet. Francis was not looking at me.<br />
</p><p>
Instead of watching and appraising me, as I had thought<br />
he was half turned round, gazing back along the fuselage<br />
or body, of our craft, for what reason I do not know.<br />
</p><p>
I turned in my seat and looked back at the tail. Not<br />
seeing anything unusual, I sat back again. And there was  <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
Francis with his head thrown back, gazing at the sky. His<br />
hands and feet were not touching the controls.<br />
</p><p>
Every time we struck an air pocket I shuddered. For<br />
ten minutes, minutes which seemed hours, I huddled<br />
and shrank and shuddered. That was about all there       <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
appeared to be in the flight for me&mdash;huddles, shrinks,<br />
and shudders.<br />
</p><p>
That dog kennel of a barn gave me much to think about.<br />
The wind was dead against us. Our speedometer registered<br />
ninety miles an hour&mdash;and the wind pushing us            <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
back at the rate of forty miles left us fifty miles an hour<br />
speed. It seemed like fifty feet to me, until I saw off in<br />
the distance ahead the silvery haze that hangs over New<br />
York like a mantle of mist. A moment later we made out<br />
Long Island Sound, laid out with all its little bays and harbors     <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
just like a pattern of white paper fallen on the extreme<br />
edge of a Persian carpet. There were a few specks on it,<br />
and from them whisps of smoke drifted up, many times<br />
smaller than pipe smoke.<br />
</p><p>
Bump! A slight jar. I looked at Francis. He was          <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
gazing ahead unconcernedly.<br />
</p><p>
Air pockets. We had dropped twenty feet on two<br />
separate occasions within the space of a moment. Great!<br />
</p><p>
The machine was still intact. Good old machine! Nice<br />
old craft! . . . I felt like patting it on the nose and stroking     <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
its sleek fabric back&mdash;that is, if it remained constant.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>If ever I craved constancy in anything, it was then.<br />
</p><p>
Suddenly I relaxed. A feeling of delightful content<br />
surged through me. Approaching New York. Above the<br />
haze, out of all the hustle and bustle of the human maelstrom.<br />
That look of absolute futility I had seen on the<br />
faces in the subway, on the streets, in the early hours of<span class="linenum">5</span><br />
morning&mdash;these receded from memory. Life was good,<br />
after all. It was a wonderful thing if you viewed it correctly.<br />
And this was the way to view it.<br />
</p><p>
Reflections of a bright young man being smeared all<br />
over the island were things of the past now, as on the right,        <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
as far as we could see, the Bronx stretched away, monotonously,<br />
endlessly. I thought how much happier I was up<br />
there, looking at the Bronx, than if I were in the Bronx<br />
down there, looking up at me.<br />
</p><p>
Straight down I made out a Sound steamer. Hell Gate      <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
Bridge, a tiny thing like the toys in shop windows.<br />
</p><p>
But the Bronx got me. I had heard much of the Bronx<br />
and once or twice had visited the Zoo. But I never conceived<br />
the Bronx as a few bushels of building blocks thrown<br />
down on a wide green lawn and tumbled about promiscuously.           <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
They were blocks, too, whole city squares, miles<br />
and miles of squares.<br />
</p><p>
And there was the Harlem River&mdash;and Harlem. I<br />
looked for the homes of the cliff dwellers. They were not<br />
there. The scenery was as flat as the side of a house.   <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
</p><p>
Veering slightly to the left, a mere touch from Francis<br />
of the auto wheel in front of him, and we were speeding<br />
over the upper East Side. Now I knew, or thought I knew,<br />
the millions who reside there, more or less in a state of<br />
perpetual congestion. I had often pondered as to where   <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
these millions hung their wash, when they washed. To-day<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>I learned.<br />
</p><p>
Arranged in crisscross rows, compactly and without wasting<br />
an inch of space, that I could see, the roofs of the East<br />
Side were literally covered, literally littered, with clothes<br />
of a sameness that made of whole blocks or squares an<br />
awning. Here and there a red shirt, the only outstanding  <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
bit of color. At least I chose to assume that it was a shirt<br />
because I knew that down in those narrow streets, moving<br />
about like minute grains of sand guided only by the confines<br />
of the conventional walls, were people sweltering in<br />
the heat of a summer day, and they needed those shirts   <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
another season.<br />
</p><p>
We dropped lower. We saw between the lines of garments,<br />
as we gazed straight downward, a bed, another bed,<br />
then a cot, more beds, a chair or two, now and then a bit<br />
of green I took to be plants, occasionally a bit of carpet           <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
on the roof&mdash;and babies. The ten or fifteen babies who<br />
do not spend their days in the middle of the streets are<br />
enjoying the pleasures of their own roof gardens. As far<br />
as we could see to the left it was the same&mdash;roofs and<br />
clothes and babies, divided into squares like cuts of frosted        <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
cake.<br />
</p><p>
We struck Fifth Avenue at 110 Street. To our right<br />
was Central Park. And it was not as large as the palm of<br />
one's hand. In fact it might have been a bare spot from<br />
which a few building blocks had been lifted, evenly and  <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
without disturbing the sharply outlined sides and corners.<br />
</p><p>
There was nothing to be seen of the beautiful drives.<br />
The wonderful trees were as clumps of sagebrush, the<br />
gathering spots mere splotches of gray in a patch of moldy<br />
green. The lakes and the reservoir were as bits of broken<span class="linenum">30</span><br />
glass with jagged edges and no reason on earth for their<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>being there.<br />
</p><p>
Below us we did make out a few of the taller buildings,<br />
but it required an effort and a prior knowledge of their location.<br />
Fifth Avenue, over which we were traveling at<br />
ninety miles an hour as we tacked across the pathway of<br />
the wind and sped southward, was like any other street    <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
from that height. One could never recognize it as Fifth<br />
Avenue, though in front of the Public Library the limousines<br />
forming two thin lines like black threads helped identify it.<br />
</p><p>
The Metropolitan tower was passed far more quickly than<br />
it requires in the telling. I looked ahead to see the wonderful <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
skyline down toward the Battery with its galaxy of skyscrapers.<br />
It was not there. Back over my shoulder I saw<br />
42 Street and Broadway. Strange to relate, the great<br />
buildings on that side of town stood up in bold relief.<br />
</p><p>
We could now take in both the North and East rivers and  <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
all of New York Bay at a single glance. A mile above them,<br />
and we were following Broadway to Battery Park. We<br />
recognized the Woolworth tower. But the Statue of<br />
Liberty was far more prominent, standing alone and distinguished,<br />
ready to meet all comers.                                <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
</p><p>
The Woolworth Building was a disappointment. I had<br />
thought to see it at its best, gaze at it from all angles; but<br />
I became far more interested in the piers that curbed our<br />
little island of Manhattan, the ferryboats that plied like<br />
toy ships, leaving scarcely a wake that we could see.    <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
</p><p>
I recalled that the giant <i>Leviathan</i> was due in, that noon,<br />
with several thousand soldiers. I scanned the bay for it.<br />
A moment later, when we had swung around in a wide circle<br />
and started back uptown, I saw it. The transport had<br />
been under us and we had not seen it. I knew there must  <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
be thousands in Battery Park to greet the <i>Leviathan</i> and<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>her heroes.<br />
</p><p>
After straining my eyes I decided that the tiny specks at<br />
certain spots in the park where there were no trees must of<br />
a surety be human beings. But they were specks.<br />
</p><p>
At this juncture all of us received a shock. The plane<br />
headed against the stiff west wind again, bumped into it  <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
head first, and then keeled halfway over. Try tipping up<br />
on one runner of a rocking chair, try balancing yourself<br />
as you go whizzing through space. I realized then that if<br />
one were placed in a rocking chair in the tonneau of a<br />
motor car and the car rounded a corner say at thirty or  <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
forty-five miles an hour, one might derive the same sensation.<br />
</p><p>
Our bodies were tugging at the life belts that held us<br />
firmly in our seats. Every muscle in my body was taut.<br />
I held my breath. Would we turn over? Would something    <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
snap and send us down? I looked to see where we<br />
would fall. We would have fallen a sheer 5000 feet, directly<br />
on the Woolworth tower, the entire building of which<br />
was little more than a toy. But we did not fall.<br />
</p><p>
The wind was better to us now, being in the rear. Yet    <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
we did not appear to be making more speed. We drifted<br />
along, apparently. A moment later we were over green<br />
fields again. Far ahead I saw a Long Island train, doubtless<br />
moving. My gaze wandered momentarily. I looked<br />
for the train. It was gone. I looked back. It was in     <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
our rear, and still coming in our direction.<br />
</p><p>
It seemed but a matter of a few breaths of piercingly cold<br />
air before we were circling Hazlehurst Field. A brief glide<br />
and we were coasting on the ground toward the exact spot<br />
we had left. I looked at the watch again.                <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
</p><p>
We had traveled from New York to the field, a distance<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>of twenty-two miles, at the rate of two miles and a half a<br />
minute. And my picture of Greater New York was that<br />
of a beautiful toy, a diamond sunburst glittering in a setting<br />
of purple and gold, a city full of windowpanes and skylights<br />
that throw back the rays of the sun&mdash;but a toy nevertheless,<br />
for verily I had beheld a city and had taken it in the    <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
palm of my hand, gazed at it in wonder a moment, and had<br />
then put it back again.<br />

<h2>PRAYER FOR THE PILOT</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Cecil Roberts</span></h3>


<div>
Lord of Sea and Earth and Air,<br />
Listen to the Pilot's prayer&mdash;<br />
Send him wind that's steady and strong,<br />
Grant that his engine sings the song<br />
Of flawless tone, by which he knows                       <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
It shall not fail him where he goes;<br />
Landing, gliding, in curve, half-roll&mdash;<br />
Grant him, O Lord, a full control,<br />
That he may learn in heights of Heaven<br />
The rapture altitude has given,                          <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
That he shall know the joy they feel<br />
Who ride Thy realms on Birds of Steel.<br />

<h2>A BATTLE WITH A WHALE</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Frank T. Bullen</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Before the discovery of petroleum, whale oil was
generally used for lighting. Whaling was then one
of the big businesses of our country. Our whalers
sought their game in all the waters of the world
where the big animals were to be found. A whaling
cruise usually lasted from two to five years. The
following description of harpooning a whale is an
actual experience of the author.</p></div>


<p>
"There she white-waters! Ah, bl-o-o-o-o-w, blow,<br />
blow!" sang Louis; and then, in another tone,<br />
"Sperm whale, sir; lone fish, headin' 'beout east-by-nothe."<br />
</p><p>
"All right. Way down from aloft," answered the<br />
skipper, who was already halfway up the main rigging; and <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
like squirrels we slipped out of our hoops and down the<br />
backstays, passing the skipper like a flash as he toiled upwards,<br />
bellowing orders as he went. Short as our journey<br />
down had been, when we arrived on deck we found all<br />
ready for a start. But as the whale was at least seven   <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
miles away and we had a fair wind for him, there was no<br />
hurry to lower, so we all stood at attention by our respective<br />
boats, waiting for the signal. I found, to my<br />
surprise, that although I was conscious of a much more<br />
rapid heartbeat than usual, I was not half so scared as I<span class="linenum">15</span><br />
expected to be&mdash; that the excitement was rather pleasant<br />
than otherwise.<br />
</p><p>
"Lower away boats!" came pealing down from the<br />
skipper's lofty perch, succeeded instantly by the rattle of<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>the patent blocks as the falls flew through them, while the          <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
four beautiful craft took the water with an almost simultaneous<br />
splash. The ship keepers had trimmed the yards<br />
to the wind and hauled up the courses, so that simply<br />
putting the helm down deadened our way and allowed the<br />
boats to run clear without danger of fouling one another. <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
To shove off and hoist sail was the work of a few moments,<br />
and with a fine working breeze away we went.<br />
</p><p>
Our boat, being the chief's, had the post of honor; but<br />
there was now only one whale, and I rather wondered<br />
why we had all left the ship. According to expectations, <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
down he went when we were within a couple of miles of<br />
him, but quietly and with great dignity, elevating his tail<br />
perpendicularly in the air and sinking slowly from our<br />
view.<br />
</p><p>
The scene was very striking. Overhead, a bright-blue sky <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
just fringed with fleecy little clouds; beneath, a deep-blue<br />
sea with innumerable tiny wavelets dancing and<br />
glittering in the blaze of the sun; but all swayed in one<br />
direction by a great solemn swell that slowly rolled from<br />
east to west, like the measured breathing of some world-supporting   <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
monster. Four little craft in a group, with<br />
twenty-four men in them, silently waiting for battle with<br />
one of the mightiest of God's creatures&mdash;one that was<br />
indeed a terrible foe to encounter were he but wise enough<br />
to make the best use of his opportunities.               <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
</p><p>
My musings were very suddenly interrupted. Whether<br />
we had overrun our distance, or the whale, who was not<br />
"making a passage" but feeding, had changed his course,<br />
I do not know; but anyhow he broke water close ahead,<br />
coming straight for our boat. His great black head, like <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
the broad bow of a dumb barge driving the waves before<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>it, loomed high and menacing to me, for I was no longer<br />
forbidden to look ahead. But coolly as if coming alongside<br />
the ship, the mate bent to the big steer oar and swung<br />
the boat off at right angles to her course, bringing her back<br />
again with another broad sheer as the whale passed foaming.<br />
This maneuver brought us side by side with him before he  <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
had time to realize that we were there. Up till that instant<br />
he had evidently not seen us, and his surprise was correspondingly<br />
great.<br />
</p><p>
To see Louis raise his harpoon high above his head and<br />
with a hoarse grunt of satisfaction plunge it into the black,        <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
shining mass beside him, up to the hitches, was indeed a<br />
sight to be remembered. Quick as thought he snatched up<br />
a second harpoon, and as the whale rolled from us it flew<br />
from his hands, burying itself like the former one, but lower<br />
down the body. The great impetus we had when we          <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
reached the whale, carried us a long way past him, out of all<br />
danger from his struggles. No hindrance was experienced<br />
from the line by which we were connected with the whale,<br />
for it was loosely coiled in a space for the purpose in the<br />
boat's bow, to the extent of two hundred feet, and this was          <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
cast overboard by the harpooner as soon as the fish was<br />
fast.<br />
</p><p>
He made a fearful to-do over it, rolling completely over<br />
several times, backward and forward, at the same time<br />
smiting the sea with his mighty tail, making an almost   <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
deafening noise and pother. But we were comfortable<br />
enough while we unshipped the mast and made ready for<br />
action, being sufficiently far away from him to escape the<br />
full effect of his gambols.<br />
</p><p>
After the usual time spent in furious attempts to free   <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
himself from our annoyance, he betook himself below, leaving<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>us to await his return and hasten it as much as possible<br />
by keeping a severe strain upon the line. Our efforts in<br />
this direction, however, did not seem to have any effect<br />
upon him at all. Flake after flake ran out of the tubs until<br />
we were compelled to hand the end of our line to the second<br />
mate, to splice his own on to. Still it slipped away, and <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
at last it was handed to the third mate, whose two tubs<br />
met the same fate. It was now Mistah Jones's turn to<br />
"bend on," which he did with many chuckles, as of a man<br />
who was the last resource of the unfortunate. But his<br />
face grew longer and longer as the never-resting line continued      <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
to disappear. Soon he signaled us that he was<br />
nearly out of line, and two or three minutes after, he bent<br />
on his "drogue" (a square piece of plank with a rope tail<br />
spliced into its center, and considered to hinder a whale's<br />
progress at least as much as four boats) and let go the end.         <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
We had each bent on our drogues in the same way, when<br />
we passed our ends to one another. So now our friend was<br />
getting along somewhere below, with 7200 feet of one-and-a-half-inch<br />
rope, and weight additional equal to the<br />
drag of sixteen thirty-foot boats.                       <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
</p><p>
Of course we knew that unless he were dead and sinking<br />
he could not possibly remain much longer beneath the<br />
surface. The exhibition of endurance we had just been<br />
favored with was a very unusual one, I was told, it being a<br />
rare thing for a cachalot to take out two boats' lines before        <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
returning to the surface to spout.<br />
</p><p>
Therefore we separated as widely as was thought necessary,<br />
in order to be near him on his arrival. It was, as<br />
might be imagined, some time before we saw the light of<br />
his countenance; but when we did, we had no difficulty   <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
in getting alongside of him again. My friend Goliath,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>much to my delight, got there first and succeeded in picking<br />
up the bight of the line. But having done so, his chance<br />
of distinguishing himself was gone. Hampered by the<br />
immense quantity of sunken line which was attached to<br />
the whale, he could do nothing and soon received orders to<br />
cut the bight of the line and pass the whale's end to us. <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
</p><p>
He had hardly obeyed, with a very bad grace, when the<br />
whale started off to windward with us, at a tremendous<br />
rate. The other boats, having no line, could do nothing to<br />
help; so away we went alone, with barely a hundred fathoms<br />
of line in case he should take it into his head to sound again.      <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
The speed at which he went made it appear as if a gale of<br />
wind were blowing, and we flew along the sea surface,<br />
leaping from crest to crest of the waves with an incessant<br />
succession of cracks like pistol shots. The flying spray<br />
drenched us and prevented us from seeing him, but I fully<span class="linenum">15</span><br />
realized that it was nothing to what we should have to<br />
put up with if the wind freshened much. One hand was<br />
kept bailing out the water which came so freely over the<br />
bows, but all the rest hauled with all their might upon the<br />
line, hoping to get a little closer to the flying monster.           <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
Inch by inch we gained on him. After what seemed a<br />
terribly long chase we found his speed slackening, and we<br />
redoubled our efforts.<br />
</p><p>
Now we were close upon him; now, in obedience to the<br />
steersman, the boat sheered out a bit and we were abreast<span class="linenum">25</span><br />
of his laboring flukes; now the mate hurls his quivering<br />
lance with such hearty good will that every inch of its<br />
slender shaft disappears within the huge body.<br />
</p><p>
"Lay off! Off with her, Louey!" screamed the mate;<br />
and she gave a wide sheer away from the whale, not a     <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
second too soon. Up flew that awful tail, descending with<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>a crash upon the water, not two feet from us.<br />
</p><p>
"Out oars! Pull, two! starn, three!" shouted the mate;<br />
and as we obeyed, our foe turned to fight.<br />
</p><p>
Then might one see how courage and skill were such<br />
mighty factors in the apparently unequal contest. The<br />
whale's great length made it no easy job for him to turn, <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
while our boat, with two oars a side and the great leverage<br />
at the stern supplied by the nineteen-foot steer oar, circled,<br />
backed, and darted ahead like a living thing animated by<br />
the mind of our commander. When the leviathan settled,<br />
we gave a wide berth to his probable place of ascent;    <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
when he rushed at us, we dodged him; when he paused, if<br />
only momentarily, in we flew and got home a fearful thrust<br />
of the deadly lance.<br />
</p><p>
All fear was forgotten now&mdash;I panted, thirsted, for his<br />
life. Once, indeed, in a sort of frenzy, when for an instant         <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
we lay side by side with him, I drew my sheath knife and<br />
plunged it repeatedly into the blubber as if I were assisting<br />
in his destruction.<br />
</p><p>
Suddenly the mate gave a howl: "Starn all&mdash;starn all!<br />
oh, starn!" and the oars bent like canes as we obeyed.   <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
There was an upheaval of the sea just ahead; then slowly,<br />
majestically, the vast body of our foe rose into the air.<br />
Up, up it went, while my heart stood still, until the whole of<br />
that immense creature hung on high, apparently motionless,<br />
and then fell&mdash;a hundred tons of solid flesh&mdash;back       <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
into the sea. On either side of that mountainous mass the<br />
waters rose in shining towers of snowy foam which fell in<br />
their turn, whirling and eddying around us as we tossed and<br />
fell like a chip in a whirlpool. Blinded by the flying spray,<br />
bailing for very life to free the boat from the water with           <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
which she was nearly full, it was some minutes before I<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>was able to decide whether we were still uninjured or not.<br />
Then I saw, at a little distance, the whale lying quietly. As<br />
I looked he spouted, and the vapor was red with his blood.<br />
</p><p>
"Starn all!" again cried our chief, and we retreated to a<br />
considerable distance. The old warrior's practiced eye had<br />
detected the coming climax of our efforts, the dying agony,           <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
or "flurry," of the great mammal. Turning upon his side<br />
he began to move in a circular direction, slowly at first,<br />
then faster and faster, until he was rushing round at<br />
tremendous speed, his great head raised quite out of water<br />
at times, clashing his enormous jaws. Torrents of blood  <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
poured from his spout hole, accompanied by hoarse bellowings<br />
as of some gigantic bull, but really caused by the<br />
laboring breath trying to pass through the clogged air<br />
passages. The utmost caution and rapidity of manipulation<br />
of the boat was necessary to avoid his maddened          <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
rush, but this gigantic energy was short-lived. In a few<br />
minutes he subsided slowly in death, his mighty body reclined<br />
on one side, the fin uppermost waving limply as he<br />
rolled to the swell, while the small waves broke gently over<br />
the carcass in a low, monotonous surf, intensifying the  <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
profound silence that had succeeded the tumult of our<br />
conflict with the late monarch of the deep.<br />

<h2>THE GLOVE AND THE LIONS</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Leigh Hunt</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This is an old tale of adventure, the incident
occurring in the days of chivalry. But it is of
sufficient dramatic interest to cause Sir Edward
Bulwer-Lytton and Robert Browning each to use it
also as the subject for a poem. As you read it try
to picture the scene as it is developed line by
line.</p></div>


<div>
King Francis was a hearty king and loved a royal<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">sport,</span><br />
And one day, as his lions fought, sat looking on the court.<br />
The nobles filled the benches, and the ladies in their pride,<br />
And 'mongst them sat the Count de Lorge with one for      <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">whom he sighed;</span><br />
And truly 'twas a gallant thing to see that crowning show,<br />
Valor and love, and a king above, and the royal beasts<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">below.</span><br />
<br />
Ramped and roared the lions, with horrid laughing jaws;  <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
They bit, they glared, gave blows like beams, a wind went<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">with their paws;</span><br />
With wallowing might and stifled roar they rolled on one<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">another,</span><br />
Till all the pit with sand and mane was in a thunderous  <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">smother;</span><br />
The bloody foam above the bars came whisking through the<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">air;</span><br />
Said Francis then, "Faith, gentlemen, we're better here<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">than there."</span> <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span><br />
De Lorge's love o'erheard the king, a beauteous lively<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">dame,</span><br />
With smiling lips and sharp bright eyes which always<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">seemed the same;</span><br />
She thought, "The count, my lover, is brave as brave can  <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">be;</span><br />
He surely would do wondrous things to show his love of me;<br />
King, ladies, lovers, all look on; the occasion is divine;<br />
I'll drop my glove to prove his love; great glory will be<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">mine."</span><span class="linenum">10</span><br />
<br />
She dropped her glove, to prove his love, then looked at<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">him and smiled;</span><br />
He bowed, and in a moment leaped among the lions wild;<br />
The leap was quick, return was quick, he has regained his<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">place,</span><span class="linenum">15</span><br />
Then threw the glove, but not with love, right in the lady's<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">face.</span><br />
"By Heaven," said Francis, "rightly done!" and he rose<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">from where he sat;</span><br />
"No love," quoth he, "but vanity, sets love a task like  <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">that."</span><br />

<h2>HOW BUCK WON THE BET</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Jack London</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Buck was a cross between St. Bernard and Scotch
shepherd bloods, and a wonderful dog he was. He
made a name for himself in Alaska, during the
Klondike gold rush, and his owner, Thornton, was
envied by all the miners in that land where dogs
take the place of horses. Thornton once boasted
that Buck could pull a thousand pounds on a
sled&mdash;break it out and "mush," or draw, it a
hundred yards. Matthewson bet a thousand dollars
that he could not.</p></div>


<p>
Matthewson's sled, loaded with a thousand pounds<br />
of flour, had been standing for a couple of hours, and<br />
in the intense cold (it was sixty below zero) the runners had<br />
frozen fast to the hard-packed snow. Men offered odds of<br />
two to one that Buck could not budge the sled. A quibble  <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
arose concerning the phrase "break out." O'Brien contended<br />
it was Thornton's privilege to knock the runners loose,<br />
leaving Buck to "break it out" from a dead standstill.<br />
Matthewson insisted that the phrase included breaking the<br />
runners from the frozen grip of the snow. A majority of the          <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
men who had witnessed the making of the bet decided in his<br />
favor, whereat the odds went up to three to one against Buck.<br />
</p><p>
There were no takers. Not a man believed him capable<br />
of the feat. Thornton had been hurried into the wager,<br />
heavy with doubt; and now that he looked at the sled     <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
itself, the concrete fact, with the regular team of ten dogs<br />
curled up in the snow before it, the more impossible the task<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>appeared. Matthewson waxed jubilant.<br />
</p><p>
"Three to one!" he proclaimed. "I'll lay you another<br />
thousand at that figure, Thornton. What d'ye say?"<br />
</p><p>
Thornton's doubt was strong in his face, but his fighting<br />
spirit was aroused&mdash;the fighting spirit that soars above<br />
odds, fails to recognize the impossible, and is deaf to all save      <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
the clamor for battle. He called Hans and Pete to him.<br />
Their sacks were slim, and with his own the three partners<br />
could rake together only two hundred dollars. In the<br />
ebb of their fortunes, this sum was their total capital;<br />
yet they laid it unhesitatingly against Matthewson's six <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
hundred.<br />
</p><p>
The team of ten dogs was unhitched, and Buck, with his<br />
own harness, was put into the sled. He had caught the<br />
contagion of the excitement, and he felt that in some way<br />
he must do a great thing for John Thornton. Murmurs of   <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
admiration at his splendid appearance went up. He was in<br />
perfect condition, without an ounce of superfluous flesh,<br />
and the one hundred and fifty pounds that he weighed were<br />
so many pounds of grit and virility. His furry coat shone<br />
with the sheen of silk. Down the neck and across the     <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
shoulders, his mane, in repose as it was, half bristled<br />
and seemed to lift with every movement, as though excess<br />
of vigor made each particular hair alive and active. The<br />
great breast and heavy fore legs were no more than in<br />
proportion with the rest of the body, where the muscles  <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
showed in tight rolls underneath the skin. Men felt these<br />
muscles and proclaimed them hard as iron, and the odds<br />
went down to two to one.<br />
</p><p>
"Gad, sir! Gad, sir!" stuttered a member of the<br />
latest dynasty, a king of the Skookum Benches. "I offer  <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
you eight hundred for him, sir, before the test, sir; eight<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>hundred just as he stands."<br />
</p><p>
Thornton shook his head and stepped to Buck's side.<br />
</p><p>
"You must stand off from him," Matthewson protested.<br />
"Free play and plenty of room."<br />
</p><p>
The crowd fell silent; only could be heard the voices of<br />
the gamblers vainly offering two to one. Everybody        <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
acknowledged Buck a magnificent animal, but twenty<br />
fifty-pound sacks of flour bulked too large in their eyes for<br />
them to loosen their pouch strings.<br />
</p><p>
Thornton knelt down by Buck's side. He took his head<br />
in his two hands and rested cheek on cheek. He did not   <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
playfully shake him, as was his wont, or murmur soft love<br />
curses; but he whispered in his ear. "As you love me,<br />
Buck. As you love me," was what he whispered. Buck<br />
whined with suppressed eagerness.<br />
</p><p>
The crowd was watching curiously. The affair was growing <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
mysterious. It seemed like a conjuration. As Thornton<br />
got to his feet, Buck seized his mittened hand between<br />
his jaws, pressing it with his teeth and releasing it slowly,<br />
half reluctantly. It was the answer, in terms not of speech<br />
but of love. Thornton stepped well back.                 <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
</p><p>
"Now, Buck," he said.<br />
</p><p>
Buck tightened the traces, then slacked them for a<br />
matter of several inches. It was the way he had learned.<br />
</p><p>
"Gee!" Thornton's voice rang out, sharp in the tense<br />
silence.                                                 <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
</p><p>
Buck swung to the right, ending the movement in a plunge<br />
that took up the slack and with a sudden jerk arrested his<br />
one hundred and fifty pounds. The load quivered, and<br />
from under the runners arose a crisp crackling.<br />
</p><p>
"Haw!" Thornton commanded.                               <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
</p><p>
Buck duplicated the maneuver, this time to the left. The<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>crackling turned into a snapping, the sled pivoting and the<br />
runners slipping and grating several inches to the side.<br />
The sled was broken out. Men were holding their breaths,<br />
intensely unconscious of the fact.<br />
</p><p>
"Now, <i>mush!</i>"<br />
</p><p>
Thornton's command cracked out like a pistol shot.        <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
Buck threw himself forward, tightening the traces with a<br />
jarring lunge. His whole body was gathered compactly<br />
together in the tremendous effort, the muscles writhing and<br />
knotting like live things under the silky fur. His great<br />
chest was low to the ground, his head forward and down,  <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
while his feet were flying like mad, the claws scarring the<br />
hard-packed snow in parallel grooves. The sled swayed<br />
and trembled, half started forward. One of his feet slipped,<br />
and one man groaned aloud. Then the sled lurched ahead<br />
in what appeared a rapid succession of jerks, though it never        <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
really came to a dead stop again&mdash;half an inch&mdash;an<br />
inch&mdash;two inches. The jerks perceptibly diminished; as<br />
the sled gained momentum he caught them up till it was<br />
moving steadily along.<br />
</p><p>
Men gasped and began to breathe again, unaware that      <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
for a moment they had ceased to breathe. Thornton was<br />
running behind, encouraging Buck with short, cheery<br />
words. The distance had been measured off, and as he<br />
neared the pile of firewood which marked the end of the<br />
hundred yards, a cheer began to grow and grow, which     <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
burst into a roar as he passed the firewood and halted at<br />
command. Every man was tearing himself loose, even<br />
Matthewson. Hats and mittens were flying in the air.<br />
Men were shaking hands, it did not matter with whom,<br />
and bubbling over in a general incoherent babel.         <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
</p><p>
But Thornton fell on his knees beside Buck. Head was<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>against head, and he was shaking him back and forth.<br />
Buck seized Thornton's hand in his teeth. As though<br />
animated by a common impulse, the onlookers drew back<br />
to a respectful distance.<br />

<h2>THE LOSS OF THE <i>DRAKE</i></h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Charlotte M. Yonge</span></h3>


<p>
The Newfoundland coast is a peculiarly dangerous one,<br />
from the dense fogs that are caused by the warm<br />
waters of the Gulf Stream. These waters rushing up from<br />
the equator here come in contact with the cold currents from<br />
the pole. As they meet, they send up such heavy vapor     <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
that day can sometimes scarcely be discerned from night;<br />
even at little more than arm's length objects cannot be distinguished,<br />
while from without, the mist looks like a thick,<br />
sheer precipice of snow.<br />
</p><p>
In such a fearful fog, on the morning of the 20th of June,           <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
1822, the small schooner <i>Drake</i> struck suddenly upon a<br />
rock and almost immediately fell over on her side, the waves<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>breaking over her. Her commander, Captain Baker,<br />
ordered her masts to be cut away, in hopes of lightening<br />
her so that she might right herself, but in vain. One boat<br />
was washed away, another upset as soon as she was<br />
launched, and there remained only the small boat called<br />
the captain's gig.                                        <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
</p><p>
The ship was fast breaking up; the only hope was that<br />
the crew might reach a small rock, the point of which could<br />
be seen above the waves at a distance that the fog made<br />
difficult to calculate, but that, it was hoped, might not be<br />
too great. A man named Leonard seized a rope and sprang  <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
into the sea, but the current was too strong for him; he<br />
was carried away in an opposite direction and was obliged<br />
to be dragged on board again.<br />
</p><p>
Then the boatswain, whose name was Turner, volunteered<br />
to make the attempt in the gig, taking a rope fastened   <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
round his body. The crew cheered him after the<br />
gallant fashion of British seamen, though they were all<br />
hanging on by the ropes to the ship, with the sea breaking<br />
over them and threatening every moment to dash the vessel<br />
to pieces. Anxiously they watched Turner in his boat, as <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
he made his way to within a few feet of the rock. There<br />
the boat was lifted high and higher by a huge wave, then<br />
hurled down on the rock and shattered to pieces; but the<br />
brave boatswain was safe, and contrived to keep his hold<br />
of the rope and to scramble up on the stone.             <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
</p><p>
Another great wave, almost immediately after, heaved<br />
up the remains of the ship and dashed her down close to<br />
this rock of safety. Captain Baker, giving up the hope of<br />
saving her, commanded the crew to leave her and make<br />
their way to the rock. For the first time he met with    <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
disobedience. With one voice they refused to leave the<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>wreck unless they saw him before them in safety. Calmly<br />
he renewed his orders, saying that his life was the last and<br />
least consideration, and they were obliged to obey, leaving<br />
the ship in as orderly a manner as if they were going ashore<br />
in harbor. But they were so benumbed with cold that<br />
many were unable to climb the rock and were swept off by  <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
the waves; among these was the lieutenant.<br />
</p><p>
Captain Baker last of all joined his crew. It was then<br />
discovered that they were at no great distance from the<br />
land, but that the tide was rising and that the rock on which<br />
they stood would assuredly be covered at high water. The <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
heavy mist and lonely coast gave scarcely a hope that help<br />
would come ere the slowly rising waters must devour them.<br />
</p><p>
Still there was no murmur. Again the gallant boatswain,<br />
who still held the rope, volunteered to make an effort to<br />
save his comrades. With a few words of earnest prayer,   <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
he secured the rope round his waist, struggled hard with the<br />
waves, and reached the shore, whence he sent back the news<br />
of his safety by a loud cheer to his comrades.<br />
</p><p>
There was now a line of rope between the shore and the<br />
rock, just long enough to reach from one to the other when           <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
held by a man at each end. The only hope of safety lay<br />
in working a desperate passage along this rope to the land.<br />
The spray was already beating over those who were<br />
crouched on the rock, but not a man moved till called by<br />
name by Captain Baker, and then it is recorded that not  <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
one, so summoned, stirred till he had used his best entreaties<br />
to the captain to take his place; but the captain<br />
had but one reply: "I will never leave the rock until every<br />
soul is safe."<br />
</p><p>
Forty-four stout sailors had made their perilous way to  <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
shore. The forty-fifth looked round and saw a poor woman<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>lying helpless, almost lifeless, on the rock, unable to move.<br />
He took her in one arm, and with the other clung to the<br />
rope. Alas! the double weight was more than the much-tried<br />
rope could bear; it broke halfway, and the poor<br />
woman and the sailor were both swallowed in the eddy.<br />
</p><p>
Captain Baker and three seamen remained, utterly cut      <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
off from hope of help. The men in best condition hurried<br />
off in search of help, found a farmhouse, obtained a rope,<br />
and hastened back; but long ere their arrival the waters<br />
had flowed above the head of the brave and faithful captain.<br />
All the crew could do was, with full hearts, to write    <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
a most touching letter to an officer who had once sailed<br />
with them in the <i>Drake</i>, entreating him to represent their<br />
captain's conduct to the Lords of the Admiralty.<br />
</p><p>
"In fact," said the letter, "during the whole business<br />
he proved himself a man whose name and last conduct      <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
ought ever to be held in the highest estimation by a crew<br />
who feel it their duty to ask, from the Lords Commissioners<br />
of the Admiralty, that which they otherwise have not the<br />
means of obtaining; that is, a public and lasting record<br />
of the lion-hearted, generous, and the very unexampled   <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
way in which our late noble commander sacrificed his<br />
life in the evening of the 20th of June."<br />
</p><p>
This letter was signed by the whole surviving crew of the<br />
<i>Drake</i>, and in consequence, a tablet in the dockyard chapel<br />
at Portsmouth commemorates the heroism of Captain        <span class="linenum">25</span><br />

<h2>THE WALRUS HUNT</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Robert M. Ballantyne</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The following episode is from <i>Ungava: A Tale of
Eskimo Land</i>, a "classic" of the fifties and
sixties. <i>Ungava</i> is full of thrilling adventure,
based on the author's own experiences as a young
fur trader in the Hudson Bay country. Ballantyne
(1825-1894) belonged to the family of famous
Edinburgh publishers that issued Scott's works.</p>

<p>Just prior to the incident quoted below, Annatock
had discovered a walrus frozen to death and was
engaged in chopping him up. Then appears walrus
number two, who was thoroughly alive.</p></div>


<p>
Not far from the spot where this fortunate discovery<br />
had been made, there was a large sheet of recently<br />
formed black ice, where the main ice had been broken away<br />
and the open water left. The sheet, although much melted<br />
by the thaw, was still about three inches thick, and quite<span class="linenum">5</span><br />
capable of supporting a man.<br />
</p><p>
While Annatock was working with his back to this ice,<br />
he heard a tremendous crash take place behind him. Turning<br />
hastily round, he observed that the noise was caused by<br />
another enormous walrus, the glance of whose large round <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
eyes, and whose loud snort, showed clearly enough that he<br />
was not frozen like his unfortunate companion. By this<br />
time the little boy had come up with Edith and the sledge,<br />
so Annatock ordered him to take the dogs behind a hummock<br />
to keep them out of sight, while he selected several     <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
strong harpoons and a lance from the sledge. Giving<br />
another lance to Peetoot, he signed to Edith to sit on the<br />
hummock while he attacked the grisly monster of the deep<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>single-handed.<br />
</p><p>
While these preparations were being made, the walrus<br />
dived, and while it was under water the man and the boy<br />
ran quickly forward a short distance and then lay down<br />
behind a lump of ice. Scarcely had they done so when the<br />
walrus came up again with a loud snort, splashing the water           <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
with its broad, heavy flippers&mdash;which seemed a sort of<br />
compromise between legs and fins&mdash;and dashing waves<br />
over the ice as it rolled about its large, unwieldy carcass.<br />
It was truly a savage-looking monster as large as a small<br />
elephant and having two tusks of a foot and a half long. <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
The face bore a horrible resemblance to that of a man.<br />
Its crown was round and bulging, its face broad and<br />
massive, and a thick, bristling mustache&mdash;rough as the<br />
spines of a porcupine&mdash;covered its upper lip and depended<br />
in a shaggy dripping mass over its mouth. After spluttering          <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
about a short time, it dived again.<br />
</p><p>
Now was Annatock's time. Seizing a harpoon and a<br />
coil of line, he muttered a few words to the boy, sprang up,<br />
and running out upon the smooth ice, stood by the edge<br />
of the open water. He had not waited here more than a    <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
few seconds when the black waters were cleft by the blacker<br />
head of the monster, as it once more ascended to renew its<br />
elephantine gambols in the pool.<br />
</p><p>
As it rose the Eskimo threw up his arm and poised the<br />
harpoon. For one instant the surprised animal raised     <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
itself breast-high out of the water and directed a stare of<br />
intense astonishment at the man. That moment was fatal.<br />
Annatock buried the harpoon deep under its left flipper.<br />
With a fierce bellow the brute dashed itself against the ice,<br />
endeavoring in its fury to reach its assailant; but the ice          <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
gave way under its enormous weight, while Annatock ran<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>back as far as the harpoon line would permit him.<br />
</p><p>
The walrus, seeing that it could not reach its enemy in<br />
this way, seemed now to be actually endowed with reason.<br />
It took a long gaze at Annatock, and then dived. But the<br />
Eskimo was prepared for this. He changed his position<br />
hastily and played his line the meanwhile, fixing the point           <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
of his lance into the ice in order to give him a more effective<br />
hold. Scarcely had he done so when the spot he had just<br />
left was smashed up, and the head of the walrus appeared,<br />
grinning, and bellowing as if in disappointment.<br />
</p><p>
At this moment Peetoot handed his uncle a harpoon, and   <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
ere the animal dived the weapon was fixed in his side.<br />
Once more Annatock changed his position; and once again<br />
the spot on which he had been standing was burst upwards.<br />
It was a terrible sight to see that unearthly-looking monster<br />
smashing the ice around it and lashing the blood-stained <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
sea into foam, while it waged such mortal war with the<br />
self-possessed and wary man. How mighty and strong<br />
the one! how comparatively weak and seemingly helpless<br />
the other! It was the triumph of mind over matter&mdash;of<br />
reason over blind brute force.                           <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
</p><p>
But Annatock fought a hard battle that day ere he came<br />
off conqueror. Harpoon after harpoon was driven into the<br />
walrus&mdash;again and again the lance pierced deep into its<br />
side and drank its lifeblood; but three hours had passed<br />
away before the dead carcass was dragged from the deep   <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
by the united force of dogs and man.<br />

<h2>THE RESCUE</h2>


<p>
On a bright moonlight night, in the month of February,<br />
1831, when it was intensely cold, the little brig which<br />
I commanded lay quietly at her anchors inside of Sandy<br />
Hook. We had had a hard time beating about for eleven<br />
days off this coast, with cutting northeasters blowing and<span class="linenum">5</span><br />
snow and sleet falling for the most part of that time.<br />
</p><p>
Forward, the vessel was thickly coated with ice, and it<br />
was hard work to handle her as the rigging and sails were<br />
stiff and yielded only when the strength of the men was<br />
exerted to the utmost. When we at length made the port,  <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
all hands were worn down and exhausted.<br />
</p><p>
"A bitter cold night, Mr. Larkin," I said to my mate as<br />
I tarried for a short time upon deck. The worthy down-easter<br />
buttoned his coat more tightly around him, and looking<br />
up to the moon replied, "It's a whistler, Captain; and   <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
nothing can live comfortably out of blankets to-night."<br />
</p><p>
"The tide is running out swift and strong, and it will be<br />
well to keep a sharp lookout for this floating ice, Mr. Larkin,"<br />
said I, as I turned to go below.<br />
</p><p>
About two hours afterward I was aroused from a sound     <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
sleep by the vigilant officer. "Excuse me for disturbing<br />
you, Captain," said he, as he detected an expression of<br />
vexation in my face, "but I wish you would turn out and<br />
come on deck as soon as possible."<br />
</p><p>
"What's the matter, Mr. Larkin?" said I.                 <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
</p><p>
"Why, sir, I have been watching a large cake of ice,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>which swept by at a distance a moment ago, and I saw<br />
something black upon it, something that I thought moved.<br />
The moon is under a cloud and I could not see distinctly,<br />
but I believe there is a child floating out to the sea, this<br />
freezing night, on that cake of ice."<br />
</p><p>
We were on deck before either spoke another word.         <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
The mate pointed out with no little difficulty the cake of<br />
ice floating off to the leeward, with its white, glittering<br />
surface broken by a black spot.<br />
</p><p>
"Get the glass, Mr. Larkin," said I; "the moon will be<br />
out of that cloud in a moment and then we can see distinctly."       <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
</p><p>
I kept my eye upon the receding mass of ice while the<br />
moon was slowly working her way through a heavy bank of<br />
clouds. The mate stood by me with the glass, and when<br />
the full light fell upon the water with a brilliancy only<span class="linenum">15</span><br />
known in our northern latitudes, I put the glass to my eye.<br />
One glance was enough.<br />
</p><p>
"Forward, there!" I hailed at the top of my voice; and<br />
with one bound I reached the main hatch and began to<br />
clear away the little cutter which was stowed in the ship's          <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
yawl.<br />
</p><p>
Mr. Larkin had taken the glass to look for himself.<br />
"There are two children on that cake of ice!" he exclaimed,<br />
as he hastened to assist me in getting out the boat.<br />
</p><p>
The men answered my hail and walked quickly aft. In      <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
a short space of time we launched the cutter, into which Mr.<br />
Larkin and myself jumped, followed by the two men who<br />
took the oars. I rigged the tiller, and the mate sat beside<br />
me in the stern sheets.<br />
</p><p>
"Do you see that cake of ice with something black upon   <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
it, my lads? Put me alongside of that and I'll give you a<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>month's extra wages when you are paid off," said I.<br />
</p><p>
They bent to their oars, but their strokes were uneven<br />
and feeble, for they were worn out by the hard duty of the<br />
preceding fortnight; and though they did their best, the<br />
boat made little more headway than the tide. It was a<br />
losing chase, and Mr. Larkin, who was suffering torture   <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
as he saw how little we gained, cried out, "Pull, lads! I'll<br />
double the captain's prize; two months' extra pay. Pull,<br />
lads! pull for life!"<br />
</p><p>
A convulsive effort at the oars told how willing the men<br />
were to obey, but the strength of the strong men was gone.           <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
One of the poor fellows washed us twice in recovering his<br />
oar and then gave out, and the other was nearly as far gone.<br />
Mr. Larkin sprang forward and seized the deserted oar.<br />
"Lie down in the bottom of the boat," said he to the man;<br />
"and, Captain, take the other oar! We must row for ourselves."       <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
</p><p>
I took the second man's place. Larkin had stripped off<br />
his coat, and as he pulled the bow, I waited for the signal<br />
stroke. It came, gently, but firm; and the next moment<br />
we were pulling a long, steady stroke, gradually increasing          <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
in rapidity until the wood seemed to smoke in the row-locks.<br />
We kept time, each by the long, deep breathing<br />
of the other.<br />
</p><p>
Such a pull! We bent forward until our faces almost<br />
touched our knees; and then throwing all our strength into           <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
the backward movement, drew on the oar until every inch<br />
covered by the sweep was gained. Thus we worked at the<br />
oars for fifteen minutes, and it seemed to me as many<br />
hours. The sweat rolled off in great drops, and I was enveloped<br />
in a steam generated from my own body.                   <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
</p><p>
"Are we almost up to it, Mr. Larkin?" I gasped out.<br />
</p><p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>"Almost, Captain," said he; "don't give up!"<br />
</p><p>
The oars flashed as their blades turned up to the moonlight,<br />
for the men who plied them were fathers and had<br />
fathers' hearts.<br />
</p><p>
Suddenly Mr. Larkin ceased pulling, and my heart for a<br />
moment almost stopped its beating; for the terrible thought           <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
that he had given out crossed my mind. But I was reassured<br />
by his voice: "Gently, Captain, gently; a stroke<br />
or two more; there, that will do," and the next moment<br />
Mr. Larkin sprang upon the ice. I started up, and calling<br />
to the men to make fast the boat to the ice, followed him.           <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
</p><p>
We ran to the dark spot in the center of the mass and<br />
found two little boys. The head of the smaller was resting<br />
in the bosom of the larger, and both were fast asleep. The<br />
lethargy which would have been fatal but for the timely<br />
rescue had overcome them.                                <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
</p><p>
Mr. Larkin grasped one of the lads, cut off his shoes, tore<br />
off his jacket, and then, loosening his own garments to the<br />
skin, placed the cold child in contact with his own warm<br />
body, carefully wrapping his overcoat around him. I did<br />
the same with the other child, and we then returned to the           <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
boat.<br />
</p><p>
The children, as we learned when we had the delight of<br />
restoring them to their parents, were playing on the cake<br />
of ice, which had jammed into a bend of the river about ten<br />
miles above New York. A movement of the tide set the     <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
ice in motion, and the little fellows were borne away that<br />
cold night and would inevitably have perished but for Mr.<br />
Larkin's espying them as they were sweeping out to sea.<br />

<h2>DESCENDING THE GRAND CA&Ntilde;ON</h2>


<p>
One of the most daring voyages in the history of<br />
American exploration was Major John Wesley Powell's<br />
descent through the Grand Ca&ntilde;on of the Colorado River,<br />
in 1869. The river had been discovered three hundred<br />
years before his memorable journey, but Major Powell was  <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
the first to explore the magnificent gorge through which it<br />
flows and to report his findings to the world.<br />
</p><p>
Major Powell was a scientist. The lack of knowledge<br />
about the Grand Ca&ntilde;on was a challenge too strong for him<br />
to resist. With a party of ten picked men he started on  <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
the perilous voyage, on May 24, 1869. He did not know<br />
that ahead of them was a seething stretch of water, two<br />
hundred miles in length, broken by rapids and waterfalls,<br />
teethed with jagged stones, and walled in by solid rock a<br />
mile high in places.                                     <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
</p><p>
Into the ca&ntilde;on shot the frail boats. Oars were soon<br />
broken on rocks, and new ones had to be made from drift<br />
logs. The constant hammering of the boats made them<br />
leaky. To calk the seams, the men had to climb thousands<br />
of feet to get resin from some stunted pine tree.        <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
More than once a boat filled with water in a turbulent<br />
passage, but the swiftness of the current carried it to more<br />
placid waters below, where it could be bailed out.<br />
</p><p>
The difficulties of the explorers were increased by the<br />
lack of daylight hours. The sun shines each day for only <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
a short time in the gorge, and twilight follows twilight in<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>close succession. Moreover, the winding passage prevented<br />
a view ahead. Falls were guessed at by the roaring of<br />
waters reverberating against the walls of rock. Upon<br />
such a warning the boats were landed, and if there was<br />
ledge room to walk, the men carried and dragged their<br />
vessels around the danger spot. If there was no shelving  <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
rock wide enough to permit a portage, the men climbed to a<br />
higher ledge and eased the boats over the falls with ropes.<br />
Sometimes nothing was left to do but to "shoot" the falls<br />
and trust to luck to get over without capsizing.<br />
</p><p>
The food supply of the crew soon ran low. The flour      <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
was water-soaked, the bacon became tainted, and much of<br />
the supply was lost by going overboard.<br />
</p><p>
Short rations, scant sleep on damp ledges, and the hard<br />
labor of navigation soon told on the men. But most of<br />
them were of tried courage and endurance. One day they   <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
came to a little patch of earth by the side of the river. On<br />
this some corn and squashes were growing&mdash;probably<br />
planted by Indian tribes living at the top of the gorge.<br />
The corn was too immature to be eaten; but the men enjoyed<br />
a feast of baked squash, even though the squashes        <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
were green.<br />
</p><p>
At the end of fifteen days all of their provisions were<br />
gone, excepting some heavy flour and dried apples. They<br />
had arrived at a place where they could climb out of the<br />
ca&ntilde;on and the question arose as to seeing the voyage finished        <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
or giving it up. Three men decided to give up; so they<br />
took their share of provisions and guns and climbed out,<br />
only to be killed shortly afterwards by the Indians. The<br />
remainder pursued their awful way, not knowing how much<br />
longer they must endure the terrible hardships.          <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
</p><p>
Suddenly, on the sixteenth day, they emerged into an<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>open space. The Grand Ca&ntilde;on had been traversed!<br />
</p><p>
Down the river they floated till the following day, when<br />
they found some settlers drawing in a fish net. These<br />
settlers had heard that Major Powell had been lost in the<br />
ca&ntilde;on and were keeping a lookout for pieces of boats.<br />
Instead, a worn but victorious party confronted them.     <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
Food in plenty was soon forthcoming, and the members of<br />
the party were feasted as heroes.<br />

<h2>NIGHT FISHING IN THE SOUTH SEAS</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Frederick O'Brien</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Mr. O'Brien spent some time among the South Sea
Islands, and had many interesting adventures there.
One of the most exciting was this encounter with a
swordfish, which he relates in a delightful manner.</p></div>


<p>
Red Chicken became my special friend and guide,<br />
and on one occasion it was our being together, perhaps,<br />
saved his life, and afforded me one of the most thrilling<br />
moments of my own.<br />
</p><p>
He and I had gone in a canoe after nightfall to spear fish<span class="linenum">5</span><br />
outside the Bay of Virgins. Night fishing has its attractions<br />
in these tropics, if only for the freedom from severe<br />
heat, the glory of the moonlight or starlight, and the waking<br />
dreams that come to one upon the sea, when the canoe rests<br />
tranquil, the torch blazes, and the fish swim to meet the<span class="linenum">10</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>harpoon. The night was moonless, but the sea was covered<br />
with phosphorescence, sometimes a glittering expanse of<br />
light, and again black as velvet except where our canoe<br />
moved gently through a soft and glamorous surface of<br />
sparkling jewels. A night for a lover, a lady, and a lute.<br />
</p><p>
Our torch of coconut husks and reeds, seven feet high,    <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
was fixed at the prow, so that it could be lifted up when<br />
needed to attract the fish or better to light the canoe.<br />
Red Chicken, in a scarlet pareu fastened tightly about<br />
his loins, stood at the prow when we had reached his<br />
favorite spot off a point of land, while I, with a paddle,           <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
noiselessly kept the canoe as stationary as possible.<br />
</p><p>
Light is a lure for many creatures of land and sea and<br />
sky. The moth and the bat whirl about a flame; the sea<br />
bird dashes its body against the bright glass of the lonely<br />
tower; wild deer come to see what has disturbed the dark <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
of the forest; and fish of different kinds leap at a torch.<br />
Red Chicken put a match to ours when we were all in readiness.<br />
The brilliant gleam cleft the darkness and sent<br />
across the blackness of the water a beam that was a challenge<br />
to the curiosity of the dozing fish. They hastened       <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
towards us, and Red Chicken made meat of those that came<br />
within the radius of his harpoon, so that within an hour or<br />
two our canoe was heaped with half a dozen kinds.<br />
</p><p>
Far off in the path of the flambeau rays I saw the swordfish<br />
leaping as they pursued small fish or gamboled for       <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
sheer joy in the luminous air. They seemed to be in pairs.<br />
I watched them lazily, with academic interest in their<br />
movements, until suddenly one rose a hundred feet away,<br />
and in his idle caper in the air I saw a bulk so immense, and<br />
a sword of such amazing size, that the thought of danger <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
struck me dumb.<br />
</p><p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>He was twenty-five feet in length, and had a dorsal fin<br />
that stood up like the sail of a small boat. But even these<br />
dimensions cannot convey the feeling of alarm his presence<br />
gave me. His next leap brought him within forty feet of<br />
us. I recalled a score of accidents I had seen, read, and<br />
heard of; fishermen stabbed, boats rent, steel-clad ships <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
pierced through and through.<br />
</p><p>
Red Chicken held the torch to observe him better, and<br />
shouted: "<i>Apau!</i> Look out! Paddle fast away!"<br />
</p><p>
I needed no urging. I dug into the glowing water<br />
madly, and the sound of my paddle on the side of the canoe           <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
might have been heard half a mile away. It served no<br />
purpose. Suddenly half a dozen of the swordfish began<br />
jumping about us, as if stirred to anger by our torch. I<br />
called to Red Chicken to extinguish it.<br />
</p><p>
He had seized it to obey when I heard a splash and the   <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
canoe received a terrific shock. A tremendous bulk fell<br />
upon it. With a sudden swing I was hurled into the air<br />
and fell twenty feet away. In the water I heard a swish,<br />
and glimpsed the giant espadon as he leaped again.<br />
</p><p>
I was unhurt, but feared for Red Chicken. He had         <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
cried out as the canoe went under, but I found him by the<br />
outrigger, trying to right the craft. Together we succeeded,<br />
and when I had ousted some of the water, Red Chicken<br />
crawled in.<br />
</p><p>
"<i>Papaoufaa!</i> I am wounded slightly," he said, as I <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
assisted him. "The Spear of the Sea has thrust me<br />
through."<br />
</p><p>
The torch was lost, but I felt a big hole in the calf of his<br />
right leg. Blood was pouring from the wound. I made a<br />
tourniquet of a strip of my pareu and, with a small harpoon,         <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
twisted it until the flow of blood was stopped. Then,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>guided by him, I paddled as fast as I could to the beach,<br />
on which there was little trouble in landing as the bay was<br />
smooth.<br />
</p><p>
Red Chicken did not utter a complaint from the moment<br />
of his first outcry, and when I roused others and he was<br />
carried to his house, he took the pipe handed him and     <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
smoked quietly.<br />
</p><p>
"The Aavehie was against him," said an old man.<br />
Aavehie is the god of fishermen, who was always propitiated<br />
by intending anglers in the polytheistic days and who still<br />
has power.                                               <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
</p><p>
There was no white doctor on the island, nor had there<br />
been one for many years. There was nothing to do but<br />
call the <i>tatihi</i>, or native doctor, an aged and shriveled<br />
man whose whole body was an intricate pattern of tattooing<br />
and wrinkles. He came at once, and with his clawlike     <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
hands cleverly drew together the edges of Red Chicken's<br />
wound and gummed them in place with the juice of the <i>ape</i>,<br />
a bulbous plant like the edible taro. Red Chicken must<br />
have suffered keenly, for the <i>ape</i> juice is exceedingly caustic,<br />
but he made no protest, continuing to puff the pipe. Over<span class="linenum">20</span><br />
the wound the <i>tatihi</i> applied a leaf, and bound the whole<br />
very carefully with a bandage of tapa cloth, folded in surgical<br />
fashion.<br />

<h2>A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Rudyard Kipling</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>No man has written more stirring tales, in prose or
verse, in recent times than Rudyard Kipling. Born
(1865) in Bombay, India, the son of an Englishman
in the civil service, he became steeped in the ways
of the men of the East. Consequently his first
writings were sketches of Anglo-Indian life,
written for Indian newspapers with which he was
connected. Then followed a series of books on
Eastern themes, some in prose and others in verse.
Among these was <i>Departmental Ditties</i> from which
the following narrative poem is taken. Read it
through first to get the story and the atmosphere
in mind.</p></div>


<div>
Kamal is out with twenty men to raise the Border side,<br />
And he has lifted the Colonel's mare that is the<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Colonel's pride:</span><br />
He has lifted her out of the stable door between the dawn<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">and the day,</span> <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
And turned the calkins upon her feet, and ridden her far<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">away.</span><br />
<br />
Then up and spoke the Colonel's son that led a troop of the<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Guides:</span><br />
"Is there never a man of all my men can say where Kamal  <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">hides?"</span><br />
<br />
Then up and spoke Mahommed Khan, the son of the<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Ressaldar,</span><br />
"If ye know the track of the morning mist, ye know where<br />
his pickets are.                                         <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span><br />
"At dusk he harries the Abazai&mdash;at dawn he is in Bonair;<br />
But he must go by Fort Bukloh to his own place to fare<br />
So if ye gallop to Fort Bukloh as fast as a bird can fly,<br />
By the favor of God ye may cut him off ere he win to the<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Tongue of Jagai.</span> <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
But if he be passed the Tongue of Jagai, right swiftly turn<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">ye then,</span><br />
For the length and the breadth of that grisly plain is sown<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">with Kamal's men.</span><br />
There is rock to the left, and rock to the right, and low<span class="linenum">10</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">lean thorn between,</span><br />
And ye may hear a breech bolt snick where never a man is<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">seen."</span><br />
<br />
The Colonel's son has taken a horse, and a raw, rough dun<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">was he,</span><span class="linenum">15</span><br />
With the mouth of a bell, and the heart of Hell, and the<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">head of the gallows tree.</span><br />
The Colonel's son to the fort has won, they bid him stay<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">to eat&mdash;</span><br />
Who rides at the tail of a Border thief, he sits not long at          <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">his meat.</span><br />
<br />
He's up and away from Fort Bukloh as fast as he can fly,<br />
Till he was aware of his father's mare in the gut of the<br />
Tongue of Jagai;<br />
Till he was aware of his father's mare with Kamal upon her            <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">back,</span><br />
And when he could spy the white of her eye, he made the<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">pistol crack.</span><br />
He has fired once, he has fired twice, but the whistling ball<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">went wide.</span><span class="linenum">30</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>"Ye shoot like a soldier," Kamal said. "Show now if ye<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">can ride."</span><br />
<br />
It's up and over the Tongue of Jagai, as blown dust-devils<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">go,</span><br />
The dun he fled like a stag of ten, but the mare like a barren         <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">doe.</span><br />
The dun he leaned against the bit and slugged his head<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">above,</span><br />
But the red mare played with the snaffle bars, as a maiden<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">plays with a glove.</span> <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
There was rock to the left and rock to the right, and low,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">lean thorn between,</span><br />
And thrice he heard a breech bolt snick tho' never a man<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">was seen.</span><br />
<br />
They have ridden the low moon out of the sky, their hoofs<span class="linenum">15</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">drum up the dawn,</span><br />
The dun he went like a wounded bull, but the mare like a<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">new-roused fawn.</span><br />
The dun he fell at a watercourse&mdash;in a woeful heap fell he,<br />
And Kamal has turned the red mare back, and pulled the   <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">rider free.</span><br />
<br />
He has knocked the pistol out of his hand&mdash;small room<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">was there to strive,</span><br />
"'Twas only by favor of mine," quoth he, "ye rode so long<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">alive:</span><span class="linenum">25</span><br />
There was not a rock for twenty mile, there was not a clump<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">of tree,</span><br />
But covered a man of my own men with his rifle cocked on<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">his knee.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span><br />
"If I had raised my bridle hand, as I have held it low,<br />
The little jackals that flee so fast were feasting all in a row:<br />
If I had bowed my head on my breast, as I have held it high,<br />
The kite that whistles above us now were gorged till she<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">could not fly."</span> <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
<br />
Lightly answered the Colonel's son: "Do good to bird and<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">beast,</span><br />
But count who come for the broken meats before thou<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">makest a feast.</span><br />
If there should follow a thousand swords to carry my     <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">bones away,</span><br />
Belike the price of a jackal's meal were more than a thief<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">could pay.</span><br />
<br />
"They will feed their horse on the standing crop, their men<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">on the garnered grain,</span><span class="linenum">15</span><br />
The thatch of the byres will serve their fires when all the<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">cattle are slain.</span><br />
But if thou thinkest the price be fair,&mdash;thy brethren wait<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">to sup.</span><br />
The hound is kin to the jackal spawn,&mdash;howl, dog, and    <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">call them up!</span><br />
And if thou thinkest the price be high, in steer and gear and<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">stack,</span><br />
Give me my father's mare again, and I'll fight my own way<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">back!"</span><span class="linenum">25</span><br />
<br />
Kamal has gripped him by the hand and set him upon his<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">feet.</span><br />
"No talk shall be of dogs," said he, "when wolf and gray<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">wolf meet.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">May I eat dirt if thou hast hurt of me in deed or breath;</span><br />
What dam of lances brought thee forth to jest at the dawn<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">with Death?"</span><br />
<br />
Lightly answered the Colonel's son: "I hold by the blood<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">of my clan:   <span class="linenum">5</span></span><br />
Take up the mare of my father's gift&mdash;by God, she has<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">carried a man!"</span><br />
The red mare ran to the Colonel's son and nuzzled against<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">his breast,</span><br />
"We be two strong men," said Kamal then, "but she loveth <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">the younger best.</span><br />
So she shall go with the lifter's dower, my turquoise-studded<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">rein,</span><br />
My broidered saddle and saddlecloth, and silver stirrups<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">twain."</span> <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
<br />
The Colonel's son a pistol drew and held it muzzle end,<br />
"Ye have taken the one from a foe," said he; "will ye take<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">the mate from a friend?"</span><br />
<br />
"A gift for a gift," said Kamal straight; "a limb for the<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">risk of a limb.</span><span class="linenum">20</span><br />
Thy father has sent his son to me, I'll send my son to him!"<br />
With that he whistled his only son, that dropped from a<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">mountain crest&mdash;</span><br />
He trod the ling like a buck in spring, and he looked like<br />
a lance in rest.                                         <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
"Now here is thy master," Kamal said, "who leads a troop<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">of the Guides,</span><br />
And thou must ride at his left side as shield on shoulder<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">rides.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span><br />
"Till Death or I cut loose the tie, at camp and board and<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">bed.</span><br />
Thy life is his&mdash;thy fate it is to guard him with thy head.<br />
So thou must eat the White Queen's meat, and all her foes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">are thine,</span> <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
And thou must harry thy father's hold for the peace of the<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Border line,</span><br />
And thou must make a trooper tough and hack thy way to<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">power&mdash;</span><br />
Belike they will raise thee to Ressaldar when I am hanged<span class="linenum">10</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">in Peshawar."</span><br />
<br />
They have looked each other between the eyes and there<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">they found no fault,</span><br />
They have taken the Oath of the Brother-in-Blood on<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">leavened bread and salt;</span> <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
They have taken the Oath of the Brother-in-Blood on fire<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">and fresh-cut sod,</span><br />
On the hilt and the haft of the Khyber knife, and the<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">wondrous Names of God.</span><br />
<br />
The Colonel's son he rides the mare and Kamal's boy the  <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">dun,</span><br />
And two have come back to Fort Bukloh where there went<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">forth but one.</span><br />
And when they drew to the Quarter Guard, full twenty<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">swords flew clear&mdash;</span> <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
There was not a man but carried his feud with the blood of<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">the mountaineer.</span><br />
"Ha' done! ha' done!" said the Colonel's son. "Put up<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">the steel at your sides!</span><br />
Last night ye had struck at a Border thief&mdash;to-night 'tis a           <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">man of the Guides!"</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span><br />
Oh, East is East, and West is West, and never the twain<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">shall meet,</span><br />
Till Earth and Sky stand presently at God's great Judgment<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Seat;</span><br />
But there is neither East nor West, Border, nor Breed, nor<span class="linenum">5</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Birth,</span><br />
When two strong men stand face to face, though they come<br />

<h2>A NIGHT AMONG THE PINES</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Robert Louis Stevenson</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This is an account of one night's camping-out
experience in the mountains of southeastern France.
Stevenson's only companion was Modestine, a donkey
"not much bigger than a dog, the color of a mouse,
with a kindly eye and a determined jaw." The
selection is especially fine in its interpretation
of night out of doors. Read it to gather the
impressions that the sights and sounds made upon
the author. Then read it to discover what you would
have listened for (and probably heard) had you been
in the same position.</p></div>


<p>
From Bleymard after dinner, although it was already<br />
late, I set out to scale a portion of the Loz&egrave;re. An<br />
ill-marked stony droveroad guided me forward; and I met<br />
nearly half a dozen bullock carts descending from the woods,<br />
each laden with a whole pine tree for the winter's firing.<span class="linenum">5</span><br />
At the top of the woods, which do not climb very high upon<br />
this cold ridge, I struck leftward by a path among the<br />
pines, until I hit on a dell of green turf, where a streamlet<br />
made a little spout over some stones to serve me for a water<br />
tap. "In a more sacred or sequestered bower . . . nor    <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
nymph, nor faunus, haunted." The trees were not old,<br />
but they grew thickly round the glade; there was no outlook,<br />
except northeastward upon distant hilltops or straight<br />
upward to the sky; and the encampment felt secure and<br />
private like a room. By the time I had made my arrangements          <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
and fed Modestine, the day was already beginning<br />
to decline. I buckled myself to the knees into my sack and<br />
made a hearty meal; and as soon as the sun went down, I<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>pulled my cap over my eyes and fell asleep.<br />
</p><p>
Night is a dead monotonous period under a roof; but<br />
in the open world it passes lightly, with its stars and dews<br />
and perfumes, and the hours are marked by changes in the<br />
face of Nature. What seems a kind of temporal death to<br />
people choked between walls and curtains, is only a light <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
and living slumber to the man who sleeps afield. All night<br />
long he can hear Nature breathing deeply and freely; even<br />
as she takes her rest, she turns and smiles; and there is<br />
one stirring hour unknown to those who dwell in houses,<br />
when a wakeful influence goes abroad over the sleeping   <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
hemisphere, and all the outdoor world are on their feet.<br />
It is then that the cock first crows, not this time to announce<br />
the dawn, but like a cheerful watchman speeding the course<br />
of the night. Cattle awake on the meadows; sheep break<br />
their fast on dewy hillsides, and change to a new lair among         <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
the ferns; and houseless men, who have lain down with<br />
the fowls, open their dim eyes and behold the beauty of<br />
the night.<br />
</p><p>
At what inaudible summons, at what gentle touch of<br />
Nature, are all these sleepers thus recalled in the same hour        <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
to life? Do the stars rain down an influence, or do we<br />
share some thrill of mother earth below our resting bodies?<br />
Even shepherds and old country folk, who are the deepest<br />
read in these arcana, have not a guess as to the means or<br />
purpose of this nightly resurrection. Towards two in the <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
morning, they declare the thing takes place; and neither<br />
know nor inquire further. And at least it is a pleasant<br />
incident. We are disturbed in our slumber only, like the<br />
luxurious Montaigne, "that we may the better and more<br />
sensibly relish it." We have a moment to look upon the   <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
stars, and there is a special pleasure for some minds in<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>the reflection that we share the impulse with all outdoor<br />
creatures in our neighborhood, that we have escaped out<br />
of the Bastille of civilization, and are become, for the time<br />
being, a mere kindly animal and a sheep of Nature's flock.<br />
</p><p>
When that hour came to me among the pines, I wakened<br />
thirsty. My tin was standing by me, half full of water.   <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
I emptied it at a draft. The stars were clear, colored and<br />
jewellike, but not frosty. A faint silvery vapor stood for<br />
the Milky Way. All around me the black fir points stood<br />
upright and stock-still. By the whiteness of the packsaddle,<br />
I could see Modestine walking round and round at the     <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
length of the tether; I could hear her steadily munching<br />
at the sward; but there was not another sound, save the<br />
indescribable quiet talk of the runnel over the stones. I<br />
lay lazily smoking and studying the color of the sky, as<br />
we call the void of space, from where it showed a reddish<span class="linenum">15</span><br />
gray behind the pines to where it showed a glossy blue-black<br />
between the stars.<br />
</p><p>
A faint wind, more like a moving coolness than a stream<br />
of air, passed down the glade from time to time; so that<br />
even in my great chamber the air was being renewed all   <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
night long. I have not often enjoyed a more serene possession<br />
of myself, nor felt more independent of material aids.<br />
The outer world, from which we cower into our houses, seemed<br />
after all a gentle, habitable place; and night after night a<br />
man's bed, it seemed, was laid and waiting for him in the<span class="linenum">25</span><br />
fields, where God keeps an open house. I thought I had<br />
rediscovered one of those truths which are revealed to<br />
savages and hid from political economists: at the least, I<br />
had discovered a new pleasure for myself. And yet even<br />
while I was exulting in my solitude I became aware of a  <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
strange lack. I wished a companion to lie near me in the<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>starlight, silent and not moving, but ever within touch.<br />
For there is a fellowship more quiet even than solitude,<br />
and which, rightly understood, is solitude made perfect.<br />
</p><p>
As I thus lay, between content and longing, a faint<br />
noise stole towards me through the pines. I thought, at<br />
first, it was the crowing of cocks or the barking of dogs at          <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
some very distant farm; but steadily and gradually it took<br />
articulate shape in my ears, until I became aware that a<br />
passenger was going by upon the highroad of the valley<br />
and singing loudly as he went. There was more of good will<br />
than grace in his performance; but he trolled with ample <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
lungs; and the sound of his voice took hold upon the hillside<br />
and set the air shaking in the leafy glens. I have<br />
heard people passing by night in sleeping cities; some of<br />
them sang; one, I remember, played loudly on the bagpipes.<br />
I have heard the rattle of a cart or carriage spring     <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
up suddenly after hours of stillness and pass, for some<br />
minutes, within the range of my hearing as I lay abed.<br />
There is a romance about all who are abroad in the black<br />
hours, and with something of a thrill we try to guess their<br />
business. But here the romance was double: first, this   <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
glad passenger, who sent up his voice in music through the<br />
night; and then I, on the other hand, buckled into my<br />
sack, and smoking alone in the pine woods between four<br />
and five thousand feet towards the stars.<br />
</p><p>
When I awoke again (Sunday, 29th September) many of      <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
the stars had disappeared, only the stronger companions<br />
of the night still burned visibly overhead; and away<br />
towards the east I saw a faint haze of light upon the horizon,<br />
such as had been the Milky Way when I was last awake.<br />
Day was at hand. I lit my lantern, and by its glowworm   <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
light put on my boots and gaiters; then I broke up some<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>bread for Modestine, filled my can at the water tap, and<br />
lit my spirit lamp to boil myself some chocolate. The blue<br />
darkness lay long in the glade where I had so sweetly<br />
slumbered; but soon there was a broad streak of orange<br />
melting into gold along the mountain top of Vivarais.<br />
A solemn glee possessed my mind at this gradual and lovely<span class="linenum">5</span><br />
coming in of day. I heard the runnel with delight; I<br />
looked round me for something beautiful and unexpected;<br />
but the still black pine trees, the hollow glade, the munching<br />
ass, remained unchanged in figure. Nothing had<br />
altered but the light, and that, indeed, shed over all a <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
spirit of life and of breathing peace, and moved me to a<br />
strange exhilaration.<br />
</p><p>
I drank my water chocolate, which was hot if it was not<br />
rich, and strolled here and there, and up and down about<br />
the glade. While I was thus delaying, a gush of steady   <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
wind, as long as a heavy sigh, poured direct out of the<br />
quarter of the morning. It was cold and set me sneezing.<br />
The trees near at hand tossed their black plumes in its<br />
passage; and I could see the thin, distant spires of pines<br />
along the edge of the hill, rock slightly to and fro against the     <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
golden east. Ten minutes after, the sunlight spread at<br />
a gallop along the hillside, scattering shadows and sparkles,<br />
and the day had come completely.<br />
</p><p>
I hastened to prepare my pack, and tackle the steep<br />
ascent that lay before me; but I had something on my     <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
mind. It was only a fancy; yet a fancy will sometimes be<br />
importunate. I had been most hospitably received and<br />
punctually served in my green caravansary. The room<br />
was airy, the water excellent, and the dawn had called me<br />
to a moment. I say nothing of the tapestries or the inimitable       <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
ceiling, nor yet of the view which I commanded from<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>the windows; but I felt I was in some one's debt for all<br />
this liberal entertainment. And so it pleased me, in a<br />
half-laughing way, to leave pieces of money on the turf<br />
as I went along, until I had left enough for my night's<br />
lodging. I trust they did not fall to some rich and churlish<br />
drover.                                                   <span class="linenum">5</span><br />

<div class="blockquot"><br /><p>1. What did Stevenson <i>see</i> during the night? What
did he <i>hear?</i> How did he <i>feel?</i> The details are
not unlike those in <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>.</p>

<p>2. Re-read the first paragraph, page 178, and tell
what its chief idea is. Select the paragraph in
which the description is clearest to you. Read it
aloud. Observe how the simple words are arranged to
make pictures and to produce rhythm. Stevenson
rewrote many times to get this easy clearness.</p>

<p>3. If you have ever slept out of doors what
impressed you most? What sounds did Stevenson
probably fail to hear? Was he a naturalist?</p>

<p>4. Stevenson was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, in
1850. He belonged to a family of civil engineers.
His health was always poor, so he traveled a great
deal. He went to France and to Switzerland. He came
to America and spent some time in the Adirondacks.
Finally he settled on an island far out in the
Pacific Ocean, where he lived till his death, in
1894. In spite of his poor health, he was a busy
writer of novels, essays, short stories, and verse.</p></div>

<h2>AUTUMN ON THE FARM</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By John Greenleaf Whittier</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This is a poetic description of an old-fashioned
autumn scene on a England farm. The huskers in the
field merely jerked the ear of corn from its stalk,
leaving the husk on the ear. The husks were
afterwards removed in the barn at a big husking bee
or picnic, in which the neighbors took part. Read
the poem for its pictures.</p></div>


<div>
It was late in mild October,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the long autumnal rain</span><br />
Had left the summer harvest fields<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All green with grass again;</span><br />
The first sharp frosts had fallen,                        <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Leaving all the woodlands gay</span><br />
With the hues of summer's rainbow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or the meadow flowers of May.</span><br />
<br />
Through a thin, dry mist, that morning,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sun rose broad and red;</span> <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
At first a rayless disk of fire,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He brightened as he sped;</span><br />
Yet even his noontide glory<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fell chastened and subdued</span><br />
On the cornfields and the orchards                       <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
And softly pictured wood.<br />
<br />
And all that quiet afternoon,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Slow sloping to the night,</span><br />
He wove with golden shuttle<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The haze with yellow light;</span><span class="linenum">20</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
Slanting through the painted beeches,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He glorified the hill;</span><br />
And beneath it pond and meadow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lay brighter, greener still.</span><br />
<br />
And shouting boys in woodland haunts                      <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Caught glimpses of that sky,</span><br />
Flecked by many-tinted leaves,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And laughed, they knew not why;</span><br />
And schoolgirls, gay with aster flowers,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beside the meadow brooks,</span> <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
Mingled the glow of autumn<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With the sunshine of sweet looks.</span><br />
<br />
From spire and barn, looked westerly<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The patient weathercocks;</span><br />
But even the birches on the hill                         <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Stood motionless as rocks.</span><br />
No sound was in the woodlands<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Save the squirrel's dropping shell,</span><br />
And the yellow leaves among the boughs,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Low rustling as they fell.</span> <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
<br />
The summer grains were harvested;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The stubble fields lay dry,</span><br />
Where June winds rolled, in light and shade,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The pale-green waves of rye;</span><br />
But still on gentle hill slopes,                         <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In valleys fringed with wood,</span><br />
Ungathered, bleaching in the sun,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The heavy corn crop stood.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span><br />
Bent low by autumn's wind and rain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Through husks that, dry and sere,</span><br />
Unfolded from their ripened charge,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shone out the yellow ear;</span><br />
Beneath, the turnip lay concealed                         <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In many a verdant fold,</span><br />
And glistened in the slanting light<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The pumpkin's sphere of gold.</span><br />
<br />
There wrought the busy harvesters;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And many a creaking wain</span> <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
Bore slowly to the long barn floor<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Its load of husk and grain;</span><br />
Till, broad and red as when he rose,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sun sank down at last,</span><br />
And like a merry guest's farewell,                       <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The day in brightness passed.</span><br />
<br />
And lo! as through the western pines,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On meadow, stream, and pond,</span><br />
Flamed the red radiance of a sky,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Set all afire beyond,</span> <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
Slowly o'er the eastern sea bluffs<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A milder glory shone,</span><br />
And the sunset and the moonrise<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Were mingled into one!</span><br />

<h2>GOLDENROD</h2>

<h2>THE PALISADES</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By John Masefield</span></h3>

<p>
(Used by permission of Dodd, Mead and Company, Publishers.)<br />
</p>


<p>
On the west side of the Hudson River there is a cliff,<br />
or crag of rock, all carved into queer shapes. It<br />
stretches along the riverside for twenty or thirty miles,<br />
as far as Tarrytown, or further, to the broad part where the<br />
stream looks like a sea. The cliff rises up, as a rule very            <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
boldly, to the height of several hundred feet. The top of<br />
it (the Jersey shore) appears regular. It is like a well-laid<br />
wall along the river, with trees and one or two white wooden<br />
houses, instead of broken glass, at the top. This wall appearance<br />
made the settlers call the crag the "Palisades."         <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
</p><p>
Where the Palisades are the grandest is just as high up as<br />
Yonkers. Hereabouts they are very stately, for they are<br />
all marshaled along a river a mile or more broad, which<br />
runs in a straight line past them, with a great tide. If you<br />
take a boat and row across to the Palisades their beauty <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
makes you shiver. In the afternoon, when you are underneath<br />
them, the sun is shut away from you; and there you<br />
are, in the chill and the gloom, with the great cliff towering<br />
up and the pinnacles and tall trees catching the sunlight<br />
at the top. Then it is very still there. You will see no <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
one along that shore. A great eagle will go sailing out, or<br />
a hawk will drop and splash after a fish, but you will see<br />
no other living thing, except at the landing. There are<br />
schooners in the river, of course, but they keep to the New<br />
York shore to avoid being becalmed.<br />
</p><p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>You can lie there in your boat, in the slack water near<br />
the crag foot, and hear nothing but the wind, the suck of<br />
the water, or the tinkle of a scrap of stone falling from the<br />
cliff face. It is like being in the wilds, in one of the desolate<br />
places, to lie there in a boat watching the eagles.       <span class="linenum">5</span><br />

<h2>ON THE GRASSHOPPER AND CRICKET</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By John Keats</span></h3>


<div>
The poetry of earth is never dead:<br />
When all the birds are faint with the hot sun,<br />
And hide in cooling trees, a voice will run<br />
From hedge to hedge about the new-mown mead;<br />
That is the grasshopper's&mdash;he takes the lead              <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
In summer luxury&mdash;he has never done<br />
With his delights, for when tired out with fun,<br />
He rests at ease beneath some pleasant weed.<br />
The poetry of earth is ceasing never:<br />
On a lone winter evening, when the frost                 <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
Has wrought a silence, from the stove there shrills<br />
The cricket's song, in warmth increasing ever,<br />
And seems to one in drowsiness half lost,<br />
The grasshopper's among the grassy hills.<br />

<h2>TO A WATERFOWL</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By William Cullen Bryant</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Bryant saw a solitary waterfowl winging its way
high up in the air in the twilight of evening. The
sight sets him thinking of the inborn sense of the
bird. Where was it going? How did it know it was on
the right way? Who gave it the power to direct its
flight? Then he imagines that the bird is bound for
its nesting place among its fellows. And he finally
gets for himself&mdash;and for us all&mdash;a fine lesson
from the flight of the waterfowl. Try to follow the
poet's thinking, step by step, as you read the
poem.</p></div>

<h2>A NIGHT IN THE TROPICS</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Richard Henry Dana, Jr.</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Those who have spent their lives on the ocean say
that we dwellers on land know nothing of life under
the open sky. The following extract is a bit of
night scenery aboard ship in the days of wooden
vessels with canvas wings.</p></div>


<p>
One night while we were in the tropics, I went out to<br />
the end of the flying jib boom upon some duty; and<br />
having finished it, turned around and lay on the boom for<br />
a long time, admiring the beauty of the sight below me.<br />
Being so far out from the deck I could look at the ship   <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
as at a separate vessel; and there rose up from the water,<br />
supported only by the small black hull, a pyramid of canvas<br />
spreading far out beyond the hull and towering up almost,<br />
as it seemed in the indistinct night, into the clouds. The<br />
sea was as still as an inland lake; the light trade wind was         <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
gently and steadily breathing from astern; the dark-blue<br />
sky was studded with the tropical stars; there was no<br />
sound but the rippling of the water under the stem; and<br />
the sails were spread out wide and high&mdash;the two lower<br />
studding sails stretching out on either side far beyond the          <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
deck; the topmost studding sails like wings to the topsails;<br />
the topgallant studding sails spreading fearlessly out above<br />
them; still higher the two royal studding sails, looking<br />
like two kites flying from the same string; and highest<br />
of all the little skysail, the apex of the pyramid, seeming          <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
actually to touch the stars and to be out of reach of human<br />
hand. So quiet, too, was the sea, and so steady the breeze,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>that if these sails had been sculptured in marble they could<br />
not have been more motionless&mdash;not a ripple on the<br />
surface of the canvas, not even a quivering of the extreme<br />
edges of the sail, so perfectly were they distended by the<br />
breeze. I was so lost in the sight that I forgot the presence<br />
of the man who came out with me, until he said (for he    <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
too, rough old man-of-war's man that he was, had been<br />
gazing at the show) half to himself, still looking at the<br />
marble sails: "How quietly they do their work!"<br />

<h2>A WINTER RIDE</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Amy Lowell</span></h3>


<div>
Who shall declare the joy of the running!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who shall tell of the pleasures of flight!</span><br />
Springing and spurning the tufts of wild heather,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sweeping, wide winged, through the blue dome of light.</span><br />
Everything mortal has moments immortal,                   <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Swift and God-gifted, immeasurably bright.</span><br />
<br />
So with the stretch of the white road before me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shining snow crystals rainbowed by the sun,</span><br />
Fields that are white, stained with long, cool, blue shadows,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Strong with the strength of my horse as we run.</span> <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
Joy in the touch of the wind and the sunlight!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Joy! With the vigorous earth I am one.</span><br />
</div>

ride tell the thrills you experienced.</p></div>

<h2>THE SNOWSTORM</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Ralph Waldo Emerson</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The following selection is an artistic description
of a winter storm. Read it carefully to get the
successive pictures that are presented. Try to
determine, as you read, when the snow fell, whether
the scenes are in the country or in town; if the
author was an actual observer of the storm or if he
wrote the poem out of imagination.</p></div>


<div>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Announced by all the trumpets of the sky,</span><br />
Arrives the snow, and driving o'er the fields,<br />
Seems nowhere to alight; the whited air<br />
Hides hills and woods, the river and the heaven,<br />
And veils the farmhouse at the garden's end.              <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
The sled and traveler stopped, the courier's feet<br />
Delayed, all friends shut out, the housemates sit<br />
Around the radiant fireplace, inclosed<br />
In a tumultuous privacy of storm.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Come see the north wind's masonry!</span> <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
Out of an unseen quarry evermore<br />
Furnished with tile, the fierce artificer<br />
Curves his white bastions with projected roof<br />
Round every windward stake, or tree, or door.<br />
Speeding, the myriad-handed, his wild work               <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
So fanciful, so savage, naught cares he<br />
For number or proportion. Mockingly,<br />
On coop or kennel he hangs Parian wreaths;<br />
A swanlike form invests the hidden thorn;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>Fills up the farmer's lane from wall to wall,            <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
Mauger the farmer's sighs; and at the gate<br />
A tapering turret overtops the work;<br />
And when his hours are numbered and the world<br />
Is all his own, retiring as he were not,<br />
Leaves, when the sun appears, astonished Art              <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
To mimic in slow structures, stone by stone,<br />
Built in an age, the mad wind's night work&mdash;<br />
The frolic architecture of the snow.<br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><br /><p>1. The first stanza describes the effect of the
storm on people. Who are some of those
inconvenienced?</p>

<p>2. In the remainder of the poem, the storm is
thought of as an architect. What words describe him
and his work? Why is he "myriad-handed?" Explain
windward; mauger; "Parian wreaths." Why is the
storm said to use the last mockingly? What other
fanciful or mischievous things does the storm do?</p>

<p>3. Express in your own words the idea in lines 3-8,
page 195. Compare the work of human builders with
the work of the storm.</p>

<h2>SNOW-BOUND</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By John Greenleaf Whittier</span></h3>


<div>
The sun that brief December day<br />
Rose cheerless over hills of gray,<br />
And darkly circled, gave at noon<br />
A sadder light than waning moon.<br />
Slow tracing down the thickening sky                      <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
Its mute and ominous prophecy,<br />
A portent seeming less than threat,<br />
It sank from sight before it set.<br />
A chill no coat, however stout,<br />
Of homespun stuff could quite shut out&mdash;                 <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span><br />
A hard, dull bitterness of cold,<br />
That checked, midvein, the circling race<br />
Of lifeblood in the sharpened face&mdash;<br />
The coming of the snowstorm told.<br />
The wind blew east; we heard the roar                     <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
Of ocean on his wintry shore,<br />
And felt the strong pulse throbbing there<br />
Beat with low rhythm our inland air.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile we did our nightly chores:<br />
Brought in the wood from out of doors,                   <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
Littered the stalls, and from the mows<br />
Raked down the herd's grass for the cows;<br />
Heard the horse whinnying for his corn;<br />
And sharply clashing horn on horn,<br />
Impatient down the stanchion rows,                       <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
The cattle shake their walnut bows;<br />
While peering from his early perch<br />
Upon the scaffold's pole of birch,<br />
The cock his crested helmet bent<br />
And down his querulous challenge sent.                   <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
<br />
Unwarmed by any sunset light<br />
The gray day darkened into night,<br />
A night made hoary with the swarm<br />
And whirl dance of the blinding storm,<br />
As zigzag, wavering to and fro,                          <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
Crossed and recrossed the wing&egrave;d snow;<br />
And ere the early bedtime came<br />
The white drift piled the window frame,<br />
And through the glass the clothesline posts<br />
Looked in like tall and sheeted ghosts.                  <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span><br />
So all night long the storm roared on:<br />
The morning broke without a sun;<br />
In tiny spherule traced with lines<br />
Of nature's geometric signs,<br />
In starry flake and pellicle,                             <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
All day the hoary meteor fell;<br />
And when the second morning shone,<br />
We looked upon a world unknown,<br />
On nothing we could call our own.<br />
Around the glistening wonder bent                        <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
The blue walls of the firmament,<br />
No cloud above, no earth below&mdash;<br />
A universe of sky and snow!<br />
<br />
The old familiar sights of ours<br />
Took marvelous shapes: strange domes and towers          <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
Rose up where sty or corncrib stood,<br />
Or garden wall, or belt of wood;<br />
A smooth white mound the brush pile showed,<br />
A fenceless drift what once was road;<br />
The bridle post an old man sat,                          <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
With loose-flung coat and high cocked hat;<br />
The well curb had a Chinese roof;<br />
And even the long sweep, high aloof,<br />
In its slant splendor, seemed to tell<br />
Of Pisa's leaning miracle.                               <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
<br />
All day the gusty north wind bore<br />
The loosening drift its breath before;<br />
Low circling round its southern zone,<br />
The sun through dazzling snow mist shone.<br />
No church bell lent its Christian tone                   <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
To the savage air; no social smoke<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span><br />
Curled over woods of snow-hung oak;<br />
A solitude made more intense<br />
By dreary-voic&egrave;d elements&mdash;<br />
The shrieking of the mindless wind,<br />
The moaning tree boughs swaying blind,                    <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
And on the glass the unmeaning beat<br />
Of ghostly finger tips of sleet.<br />

<h2>TOM PINCH'S RIDE</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Charles Dickens</span></h3>


<p>
It was a charming evening, mild and bright. The four<br />
grays skimmed along, as if they liked it quite as well<br />
as Tom did; the bugle was in as high spirits as the grays;<br />
the coachman chimed in sometimes with his voice; the<br />
wheels hummed cheerfully in unison; the brass work on     <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
the harness was an orchestra of little bells; and thus as they<br />
went clinking, jingling, rattling smoothly on, the whole<br />
concern, from the buckles of the leaders' coupling reins to<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>the handle of the boot, was one great instrument of music.<br />
</p><p>
Yo-ho! Past hedges, gates, and trees; past cottages, and<br />
barns, and people going home from work. Yo-ho! Past<br />
donkey chaises drawn aside into the ditch, and empty<br />
carts with rampant horses whipped up at a bound upon the<br />
little watercourse and held by struggling carters close to<span class="linenum">5</span><br />
the five-barred gate until the coach had passed the narrow<br />
turning in the road. Yo-ho! By churches dropped down<br />
by themselves in quiet nooks, with rustic burial grounds<br />
about them, where the graves are green and daisies sleep&mdash;for<br />
it is evening&mdash;on the bosoms of the dead.                <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
</p><p>
Yo-ho! Past streams in which the cattle cool their feet,<br />
and where the rushes grow; past paddock fences, farms,<br />
and rickyards; past last year's stacks, cut slice by slice<br />
away, and showing in the waning light like ruined gables,<br />
old and brown. Yo-ho! Down the pebbly dip, and through   <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
the merry water splash, and up at a canter to the level<br />
road again. Yo-ho! Yo-ho!<br />
</p><p>
Yo-ho! Among the gathering shades, making of no<br />
account the reflection of the trees, but scampering on<br />
through light and darkness, all the same, as if the light of         <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
London fifty miles away were quite enough to travel by,<br />
and some to spare. Now, with a clattering of hoofs and<br />
striking out of fiery sparks, across the old stone bridge,<br />
and down again into the shadowy road, and through the<br />
open gate, and far away, into the world. Yo-ho!          <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
</p><p>
See the bright moon! High up before we know it,<br />
making the earth reflect the objects on its breast like water&mdash;hedges,<br />
trees, low cottages, church steeples, blighted stumps,<br />
and flourishing young slips, have all grown vain upon a<br />
sudden, and mean to contemplate their own fair images till           <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
morning. The poplars yonder rustle, that their quivering<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>leaves may see themselves upon the ground. Not so the<br />
oak; trembling does not become him; and he watches<br />
himself in his stout old burly steadfastness without the<br />
motion of a twig.<br />
</p><p>
The moss-grown gate, ill-poised upon its creaking hinges,<br />
crippled and decayed, swings to and fro before its glass  <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
like some fantastic dowager: while our own ghostly likeness<br />
travels on, through ditch and brake, upon the plowed land<br />
and the smooth, along the steep hillside and steeper wall,<br />
as if it were a phantom hunter.<br />
</p><p>
Yo-ho! Why, now we travel like the moon herself.         <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
Hiding this minute in a grove of trees; next minute in a<br />
patch of vapor; emerging now upon our broad, clear course;<br />
withdrawing now, but always dashing on, our journey is a<br />
counterpart of hers. Yo-ho! A match against the moon.<br />
</p><p>
The beauty of the night is hardly felt when day comes    <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
leaping up. Two stages, and the country roads are almost<br />
changed to a continuous street. Yo-ho! Past market<br />
gardens, rows of houses, villas, crescents, terraces, and<br />
squares, and in among the rattling pavements. Yo-ho!<br />
Down countless turnings, and through countless mazy      <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
ways, until an old innyard is gained, and Tom Pinch, getting<br />
down quite stunned and giddy, is in London.<br />
</p><p>
"Five minutes before the time, too!" said the driver, as<br />
he received his fee from Tom.<br />
</p>

<h2>ODE TO A BUTTERFLY</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Thomas Wentworth Higginson</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The poet watches the butterfly and speaks to it,
guessing in a fanciful way at its origin,
commenting on its way of life, and thinking of the

Thou spark of life that wavest wings of gold,<br />

Through gorgeous cipher, past the reach of words,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet dear to every child</span> <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In glad pursuit beguiled,</span><br />
Living his unspoiled days mid flowers and flocks and herds!<br />

What secret tie binds thee to other flowers,<br />
Still held within the garden's fostering?                <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
Will they too soar with the completed hours,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Take flight, and be like thee</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Irrevocably free,</span><br />
Hovering at will o'er their parental bowers?<br />
<br />
Or is thy luster drawn from heavenly hues&mdash;              <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
A sumptuous drifting fragment of the sky,<br />
Caught when the sunset its last glance imbues<br />
With sudden splendor, and the treetops high<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Grasp that swift blazonry,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then lend those tints to thee, </span> <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
On thee to float a few short hours, and die?<br />

Birds have their nests; they rear their eager young,<br />
And flit on errands all the livelong day;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Unfettered through the wood,</span> <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Seeking thine airy food,</span><br />
The sweetness spiced on every blossomed spray.<br />

<h2>IN THE DESERT</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By A. W. Kinglake</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The following sketch vividly describes an English
traveler's impression of the desert country that
lies between Jerusalem and Cairo. Mr. Kinglake had
only an interpreter, two Arabian attendants and two
camels in his little caravan.</p>

<p><i>Eothen</i>, the title of the volume from which this
selection is extracted, is a Greek word meaning
"From the East."</p></div>


<p>
Once during this passage my Arabs lost their way<br />
among the hills of loose sand that surrounded us,<br />
but after a while we were lucky enough to recover our right<br />
line of march. The same day we fell in with a sheik, the<br />
head of a family that actually dwells at no great distance<span class="linenum">5</span><br />
from this part of the desert during nine months of the year.<br />
The man carried a matchlock, and of this he was inordinately<br />
proud, on account of the supposed novelty and ingenuity<br />
of the contrivance. We stopped, and sat down and<br />
rested awhile, for the sake of a little talk.            <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
</p><p>
There was much that I should have liked to ask this man,<br />
but he could not understand Dthemetri's language, and<br />
the process of getting at his knowledge by double interpretation<br />
through my Arabs was tedious. I discovered,<br />
however (and my Arabs knew of that fact), that this man  <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
and his family lived habitually for nine months of the year<br />
without touching or seeing either bread or water. The<br />
stunted shrub growing at intervals through the sand in<br />
this part of the desert enables the camel mares to yield a<br />
little milk, and this furnishes the sole food and drink of           <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>their owner and his people. During the other three months<br />
(the hottest, I suppose) even this resource fails, and then<br />
the sheik and his people are forced to pass into another<br />
district. You would ask me why the man should not<br />
remain always in that district which supplies him with<br />
water during three months of the year, but I don't know   <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
enough of Arab politics to answer the question.<br />
</p><p>
The sheik was not a good specimen of the effect produced<br />
by his way of living. He was very small, very spare, and<br />
sadly shriveled&mdash;a poor overroasted snipe&mdash;a mere<br />
cinder of a man. I made him sit down by my side, and     <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
gave him a piece of bread and a cup of water from out of<br />
my goatskins. This was not a very tempting drink to<br />
look at, for it had become turbid and was deeply reddened<br />
by some coloring matter contained in the skins; but it<br />
kept its sweetness and tasted like a strong decoction of <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
Russia leather. The sheik sipped this drop by drop with<br />
ineffable relish, and rolled his eyes solemnly round after<br />
every draft as though the drink were the drink of the<br />
Prophet and had come from the seventh heaven.<br />
</p><p>
An inquiry about distances led to the discovery that this<span class="linenum">20</span><br />
sheik had never heard of the division of time into hours.<br />
</p><p>
About this part of my journey I saw the likeness of a<br />
fresh-water lake. I saw, as it seemed, a broad sheet of<br />
calm water stretching far and fair towards the south&mdash;stretching<br />
deep into winding creeks and hemmed in by                <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
jutting promontories, and shelving smooth off toward the<br />
shallow side. On its bosom the reflected fire of the sun lay<br />
playing and seeming to float as though upon deep, still<br />
waters.<br />
</p><p>
Though I knew of the cheat, it was not till the spongy   <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
foot of my camel had almost trodden in the seeming lake<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>that I could undeceive my eyes, for the shore line was quite<br />
true and natural. I soon saw the cause of the phantasm.<br />
A sheet of water, heavily impregnated with salts, had<br />
gathered together in a vast hollow between the sand hills,<br />
and when dried up by evaporation had left a white saline<br />
deposit; this exactly marked the space which the waters   <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
had covered, and so traced out a good shore line. The<br />
minute crystals of the salt, by their way of sparkling in<br />
the sun, were made to seem like the dazzled face of a lake<br />
that is calm and smooth.<br />
</p><p>
The pace of the camel is irksome, and makes your         <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
shoulders and loins ache from the peculiar way in which<br />
you are obliged to suit yourself to the movements of the<br />
beast; but one soon, of course, becomes inured to the work,<br />
and after my first two days, this way of traveling became so<br />
familiar to me that (poor sleeper as I am) I now and then<span class="linenum">15</span><br />
slumbered for some moments together on the back of my<br />
camel.<br />
</p><p>
After the fifth day of my journey, I no longer traveled<br />
over the shifting hills but came upon a dead level&mdash;a dead<br />
level bed of sand, quite hard, and studded with small shining        <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
pebbles.<br />
</p><p>
The heat grew fierce; there was no valley, no hollow,<br />
no hill, no mound, no shadow of hill nor of mound, by which<br />
I could mark the way I was making. Hour by hour I<br />
advanced, and saw no change. I was still the very center <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
of a round horizon. Hour by hour I advanced, and still<br />
there was the same, and the same, and the same&mdash;the<br />
same circle of flaming sky&mdash;the same circle of sand still<br />
glaring with light and fire. Over all the heaven above,<br />
over all the earth beneath, there was no visible power that          <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
could balk the fierce will of the sun. "He rejoiced as a<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>strong man to run a race; his going forth was from the end<br />
of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it: and there<br />
was nothing hid from the heat thereof." From pole to<br />
pole, and from the east to the west, he brandished his<br />
fiery scepter as though he had usurped all heaven and<br />
earth. As he bid the soft Persian in ancient times, so    <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
now, and fiercely too, he bid me bow down and worship<br />
him; so now in his pride he seemed to command me, and<br />
say, "Thou shalt have none other gods but me." I was<br />
all alone before him. There were these two pitted together,<br />
and face to face&mdash;the mighty sun for one, and for        <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
the other this poor, pale, solitary Self of mine.<br />
</p><p>
But on the eighth day, and before I had yet turned away<br />
from Jehovah for the glittering god of the Persians, there<br />
appeared a dark line upon the edge of the forward horizon,<br />
and soon the line deepened into a delicate fringe that   <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
sparkled here and there as though it were sown with diamonds.<br />
There, then, before me were the gardens and the<br />
minarets of Egypt, and the mighty works of the Nile, and<br />
I, I had lived to see, and I saw them.<br />
</p><p>
When evening came I was still within the confines of the <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
desert, and my tent was pitched as usual; but one of my<br />
Arabs stalked away rapidly toward the west without telling<br />
me of the errand on which he was bent. After a while he<br />
returned. He had toiled on a graceful service; he had<br />
traveled all the way on to the border of the living world,           <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
and brought me back for a token an ear of rice, full, fresh,<br />
and green.<br />

<h2>MAY IS BUILDING HER HOUSE</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Richard Le Gallienne</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This poem is a series of clearly drawn pictures
grouped about a central image of the month of May
as the builder of a house. While you read it,
preferably aloud, try to see the pictures and feel
the rhythm of the words. The thought in the last
stanza may remind you of the "Ode to a Butterfly."
Richard Le Gallienne is a poet of our own day, now
living in this country.</p>

<div>
May is building her house. With apple blooms<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She is roofing over the glimmering rooms;</span><br />
Of the oak and the beech hath she builded its beams,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And, spinning all day at her secret looms,</span><br />
With arras of leaves each wind-swayed wall                <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
She pictureth over, and peopleth it all<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With echoes and dreams</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And singing of streams.</span><br />
<br />
May is building her house. Of petal and blade,<br />
Of the roots of the oak, is the flooring made;           <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With a carpet of mosses and lichen and clover,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Each small miracle over and over,</span><br />
And tender, traveling green things strayed.<br />
<br />
Her windows, the morning and evening star,<br />
And her rustling doorways, ever ajar                     <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With the coming and going</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of fair things blowing,</span><br />
The thresholds of the four winds are.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span><br />
May is building her house. From the dust of things<br />
She is making the songs and the flowers and the wings;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From October's tossed and trodden gold</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She is making the young year out of the old;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Yea: out of winter's flying sleet</span> <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">She is making all the summer sweet,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And the brown leaves spurned of November's feet</span><br />
She is changing back again to spring's.<br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><br /><p>1. What form the roof, the beams, the floors, the
doors and windows, of the house of May? What is
arras? When was it used? Why was it so called? What
form the hangings and the carpets of the house? Who
inhabit it? Why are the rooms "glimmering"?</p>

<p>2. What is October's "tossed and trodden gold"? Is
the poet telling the truth in the last stanza?
Explain what is meant.</p>

<p>3. This verse is different in form from most that
you have studied. Do you think it is especially
suited to the subject?</p></div>

<h2>THE DAFFODILS</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By William Wordsworth</span></h3>

<div>
I wandered lonely as a cloud<br />
That floats on high o'er vales and hills,<br />
When all at once I saw a crowd,<br />
A host of golden daffodils;<br />
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,                       <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.<br />
<br />
Continuous as the stars that shine<br />
And twinkle on the Milky Way,<br />
They stretched in never-ending line<br />
Along the margin of a bay;                               <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,<br />
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span><br />
The waves beside them danced; but they<br />
Outdid the sparkling waves in glee:<br />
A poet could not but be gay<br />
In such a jocund company:<br />
I gazed&mdash;and gazed&mdash;but little thought                    <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
What wealth the show to me had brought:<br />
<br />
For oft, when on my couch I lie<br />
In vacant or in pensive mood,<br />
They flash upon that inward eye<br />
Which is the bliss of solitude;                          <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
And then my heart with pleasure fills,<br />
And dances with the daffodils.<br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><br /><p>1. Have you ever seen a daffodil? If not, find out
all you can about the color, time of blooming, etc.
of this flower. Remember that the scene of the poem
is the north of England.</p>

<p>2. Put briefly into your own words the experience,
as told in the first three stanzas, and its result,
as told in the last stanza. At what time of year
did the incident occur? Was the day fair or cloudy?
Why did the flowers show up so well against the
lake as a background? What change took place in the
poet's state of mind while he looked at the
flowers? What was the wealth that the sight brought
him?</p>

<p>3. Wordsworth's purpose in poetry was "awakening
the mind's attention . . . by directing it to the
loveliness and wonders of the world before us." His
best poetry is about things out of doors and their
influence on people's minds. You may like to read
"Fidelity," "To the Cuckoo," "The Solitary Reaper,"
"The Reverie of Poor Susan," and others that you
find for yourself.</p>

<p>4. Wordsworth was born in 1770, at Cockermouth,
England, and was educated at Cambridge University.
He gave all his time to writing poetry and lived an
uneventful life, surrounded by his family and
friends, in the beautiful Lake District, in the
North of England, which he describes in his poems.
From 1843 till his death in 1850 he was Poet
Laureate of England.</p></div>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Robert Southey</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Robert Southey (1774-1843) was Poet Laureate of
England from 1815 till his death. He wrote several
long poems and a great deal of history and

</div>

<div class="blockquot"><br /><p>1. The Falls of Lodore, in the Lake District,
England, consist of a series of cascades in which a
small stream rushes over a great rock about 200
feet high.</p>

<p>2. Read this poem aloud and notice how the sound
fits the sense. Does it give you an idea of the
sound of the waterfall? Why do you think the poet
uses first two, then three, and then four,
participles to a line? Other poems in which this
method of creating an impression of sound and
motion is used are Poe's "The Bells" and parts of
Browning's "How We Brought the Good News from Ghent
to Aix" and "The Pied Piper." Words like <i>bubble</i>
and <i>gurgle</i> imitate sounds. Look for such words in
this poem and elsewhere.</p>

<p>3. Compare this poem with Lowell's "The Fountain,"
Tennyson's "The Brook," and Lanier's "Song of the
Chattahoochee." Decide which you like best, and
why.</p></div>

<h2>AN ADVENTURE IN BROTHERHOOD</h2>


<p>
In an ancient city of the East there were seven brothers<br />
who were constantly quarreling among themselves. They<br />
fell out about the way their father divided his property<br />
among them; they argued about the number of camels<br />
each had a right to; they disagreed over the management   <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
of their business; and altogether they behaved so<br />
rudely to each other that their acquaintances came to speak<br />
of them as the "unbrotherly brothers."<br />
</p><p>
Their father was much grieved over the actions of his<br />
sons, and he pondered long what means to take to teach them          <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
a lasting lesson. At length he called them together in<br />
his own house and spoke to them in this manner:<br />
</p><p>
"As you know, I still have much wealth of my own. The<br />
whole of this I shall bequeath to that son of mine who can<br />
perform a task I have to set. Should two or more succeed,<span class="linenum">15</span><br />
the property will be divided equally among the winners.<br />
But before any of you can take part in this contest, each<br />
must pledge himself to live up fully to any lesson he may<br />
have exemplified here this day. Are you willing to make<br />
me this promise?"                                        <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
</p><p>
Each stepped forth in turn and gave a solemn assurance to<br />
his father that come what might he would be true in spirit<br />
and in deed to any lesson that the test might bring forth.<br />
</p><p>
The father then took from a chest a bundle of seven sticks,<br />
ingeniously tied together. "In accordance with what I    <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
have said," he told them, "whichever of you breaks these<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>sticks shall be the winner of the prize."<br />
</p><p>
Each tried in turn, beginning with the youngest. Each<br />
tugged and strained in vain. At best the bundle could only<br />
be bent. Finally the turn of the seventh came, and he<br />
too was unsuccessful. They all said the task could not be<br />
done and agreed that they had failed.                     <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
</p><p>
Thereupon the father took the bundle, sought out the<br />
end of the cord that held the sticks together, and unwound<br />
it at a single pull. Seizing each stick separately he broke<br />
all seven, one after another, before his astonished sons<br />
could protest.                                           <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
</p><p>
"Now," said he, "those broken sticks are you, my seven<br />
sons. As long as you hold together, nobody can break your<br />
friendship or your reputation. When you fall apart, anybody<br />
can make broken reeds of you. Need I say more<br />
about the lesson that you have pledged yourselves to learn           <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
in spirit and in deed?"<br />
</p><p>
The rebuke touched the seven brothers. They agreed to<br />
forget their petty grievances, thanked their father for the<br />
lesson he had taught them, and gladly joined in a big feast<br />
he had had prepared. And thereafter all who knew them    <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
spoke of them as "the seven blood brothers."<br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><br /><p>1. Did the seven brothers have any good reason for
quarreling? About what matters did they disagree?
What is the difference between disagreeing and
quarreling? How did they probably get into their
contentious habits?</p>

<p>2. What was their father's agreement with them? Was
it a fair one? What part of the story is
illustrated on page 214?</p>

<p>3. This is an old story retold. Groups of seven,
three, or twelve are very common in folk tales and
legends. See how many famous groups of seven you
can find.</p></div>

<h2>GET OUT OR GET IN LINE</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Elbert Hubbard</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This selection is a sermon that begins with an
illustration. The text is the title. The whole
incident of Lincoln's letter to Hooker is used to
enforce the text, whose title might be "Loyalty."
Why?</p>

<p>Elbert Hubbard (1859-1915) is an American writer of
essays and biography. He was interested in the
revival of the old handicrafts, especially in the
art of printing and binding books.</p></div>


<p>
If all the letters, messages, and speeches of Lincoln were<br />
destroyed except that one letter to Hooker, we should<br />
still have a good index to the heart of "The Rail-splitter."<br />
</p><p>
In this letter we see that Lincoln ruled his own spirit;<br />
and we also behold the fact that he could rule others.    <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
The letter shows frankness, kindliness, wit, tact, wise<br />
diplomacy, and infinite patience.<br />
</p><p>
Hooker had harshly and unjustly criticized Lincoln,<br />
his commander in chief, and he had embarrassed Burnside,<br />
his ranking officer. But Lincoln waives all this in deference        <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
to the virtues that he believes Hooker possesses, and promotes<br />
him to succeed Burnside. In other words, the man<br />
who had been wronged promotes the man who had wronged<br />
him, over the head of a man whom the promotee had wronged<br />
and for whom the promoter had a warm personal friendship.<span class="linenum">15</span><br />
</p><p>
But all personal considerations were sunk in view of the<br />
end desired. Yet it was necessary that the man promoted<br />
should know the truth, and Lincoln told it to him in a way<br />
that did not humiliate nor fire to foolish anger, but which<br />
certainly prevented the attack of cerebral elephantiasis to          <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>which Hooker was liable.<br />
</p><p>
Perhaps we had better give the letter entire, and so here<br />
it is:<br />
</p><p>
"Executive Mansion, Washington, January 26, 1863.<br />
Major-General Hooker:<br />
General:&mdash;                                                <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
</p><p>
I have placed you at the head of the Army of the<br />
Potomac. Of course I have done this upon what appear<br />
to me to be sufficient reasons, and yet I think it best for<br />
you to know that there are some things in regard to which<br />
I am not quite satisfied with you.                       <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
</p><p>
I believe you to be a brave and skillful soldier, which,<br />
of course, I like. I also believe you do not mix politics<br />
with your profession, in which you are right.<br />
</p><p>
You have confidence in yourself, which is a valuable, if<br />
not indispensable, quality.                              <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
</p><p>
You are ambitious, which, within reasonable bounds,<br />
does good rather than harm; but I think that during<br />
General Burnside's command of the army you have taken<br />
counsel of your ambition and thwarted him as much as you<br />
could, in which you did a great wrong to the country and <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
to a most meritorious and honorable brother officer.<br />
</p><p>
I have heard, in such a way as to believe it, of your<br />
recently saying that both the army and the government<br />
needed a dictator. Of course it was not for this, but in<br />
spite of it, that I have given you the command. Only     <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
those generals who gain successes can set up dictators.<br />
What I now ask of you is military success, and I will risk<br />
the dictatorship. The government will support you to the<br />
utmost of its ability, which is neither more nor less than<br />
it has done and will do for all commanders. I much       <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
fear that the spirit you have aided to infuse into the army,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>of criticizing their commander and withholding confidence<br />
from him, will now turn upon you. I shall assist you as<br />
far as I can to put it down. Neither you nor Napoleon,<br />
if he were alive again, could get any good out of an army<br />
while such a spirit prevails in it. And now beware of<br />
rashness; beware of rashness, but with energy and sleepless           <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
vigilance go forward and give us victories.<br />
</p><div>
<span style="margin-left: 15em;">Yours very truly,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">A. Lincoln."</span><br />
</div><p>
One point in this letter is especially worth our consideration,<br />
for it suggests a condition that springs up like         <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
deadly nightshade from a poisonous soil. I refer to the<br />
habit of sneering, carping, grumbling at, and criticizing<br />
those who are above us.<br />
</p><p>
The man who is anybody and who does anything is<br />
surely going to be criticized, vilified, and misunderstood.          <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
This is a part of the penalty for greatness and every great<br />
man understands it; and understands, too, that it is no<br />
proof of greatness. The final proof of greatness lies in being<br />
able to endure contumely without resentment. Lincoln<br />
did not resent criticism; he knew that every life must be its        <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
own excuse for being; but look how he calls Hooker's<br />
attention to the fact that the dissension Hooker has sown is<br />
going to return and plague him! "Neither you nor Napoleon,<br />
were he alive, could get any good out of an army<br />
while such a spirit prevails in it." Hooker's fault falls on         <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
Hooker&mdash;others suffer, but Hooker suffers most of all.<br />
</p><p>
Not long ago I met a college student, home on a vacation.<br />
I am sure he did not represent the true college<br />
spirit, for he was full of criticism and bitterness toward<br />
the institution. The president of the college came in for<span class="linenum">30</span><br />
his share, and I was supplied items, facts, data, with<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>times and places, for a "peach of a roast."<br />
</p><p>
Very soon I saw the trouble was not with the college,<br />
the trouble was with the young man. He had mentally<br />
dwelt on some trivial slights until he had got so out of<br />
harmony with the institution that he had lost the power to<br />
derive any benefit from it. No college is a perfect institution&mdash;a    <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
fact, I suppose, that most college presidents and<br />
college men are quite willing to admit; but a college does<br />
supply certain advantages, and it depends upon the students<br />
whether they will avail themselves of these advantages<br />
or not.                                                  <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
</p><p>
If you are a student in a college, seize upon the good that<br />
is there. You get good by giving it. You gain by giving&mdash;so<br />
give sympathy and cheerful loyalty to the institution.<br />
Be proud of it. Stand by your teachers&mdash;they are doing<br />
the best they can. If the place is faulty, make it a better          <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
place by an example of cheerfully doing your work every<br />
day the best you can. Mind your own business.<br />
</p><p>
If the concern where you are employed is all wrong,<br />
and the Old Man is a curmudgeon, it may be well for you to<br />
go to the Old Man and confidentially, quietly, and kindly<span class="linenum">20</span><br />
tell him that he is a curmudgeon. Explain to him that his<br />
policy is absurd and preposterous. Then show him how to<br />
reform his ways, and you might offer to take charge of the<br />
concern and cleanse it of its secret faults.<br />
</p><p>
Do this, or if for any reason you should prefer not, then<span class="linenum">25</span><br />
take your choice of these: Get Out or Get in Line. You<br />
have got to do one or the other&mdash;now make your choice.<br />
If you work for a man, in heaven's name work for him!<br />
</p><p>
If he pays you wages that supply you your bread and<br />
butter, work for him&mdash;speak well of him, think well of   <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>him, stand by him, and stand by the institution he represents.<br />
</p><p>
I think if I worked for a man I would work for him; I<br />
would not work for him a part of the time, and the rest of<br />
the time work against him. I would give an undivided<br />
service or none. If put to the pinch, an ounce of loyalty is<br />
worth a pound of cleverness.                              <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
</p><p>
If you must vilify, condemn, and eternally disparage,<br />
why, resign your position, and when you are outside,<br />
damn to your heart's content. But, I pray you, so long<br />
as you are a part of an institution, do not condemn it.<br />
Not that you will injure the institution&mdash;not that&mdash;but  <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
when you disparage the concern of which you are a part,<br />
you disparage yourself.<br />
</p><p>
More than that, you are loosening the tendrils that<br />
hold you to the institution, and the first high wind that<br />
comes along, you will be uprooted and blown away in the  <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
blizzard's track&mdash;and probably you will never know why.<br />
The letter only says "Times are dull and we regret there<br />
is not enough work," et cetera.<br />
</p><p>
Everywhere you find those out-of-a-job fellows. Talk<br />
with them and you will find that they are full of railing,           <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
bitterness, and condemnation. That was the trouble&mdash;through<br />
a spirit of faultfinding they got themselves swung<br />
around so they blocked the channel and had to be dynamited.<br />
They are out of harmony with the concern, and<br />
no longer being a help they had to be removed. Every     <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
employer is constantly looking for people who can help him;<br />
naturally he is on the lookout among his employees for those<br />
who do not help, and everything and everybody that is a<br />
hindrance has to go. This is the law of trade&mdash;do not<br />
find fault with it; it is founded on nature. The reward  <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
is only for the man that helps, and in order to help, you<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>must have sympathy.<br />
</p><p>
You cannot help the Old Man so long as you are explaining<br />
in undertone and whisper, by gesture and suggestion, by<br />
thought and mental attitude, that he is a curmudgeon and<br />
his system dead wrong. You are not necessarily menacing<br />
him by stirring up discontent and warming envy into strife,           <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
but you are doing this: You are getting yourself upon a well-greased<br />
chute that will give you a quick ride down and out.<br />
</p><p>
When you say to other employees that the Old Man is a<br />
curmudgeon, you reveal the fact that you are one; and<br />
when you tell that the policy of the institution is "rotten,"        <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
you surely show that yours is.<br />
</p><p>
Hooker got his promotion even in spite of his failings;<br />
but the chances are that your employer does not have the<br />
love that Lincoln had&mdash;the love that suffereth long and is<br />
kind. But even Lincoln could not protect Hooker forever. <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
Hooker failed to do the work, and Lincoln had to try some<br />
one else. So there came a time when Hooker was superseded<br />
by a Silent Man, who criticized no one, railed at nobody&mdash;not<br />
even the enemy. And this Silent Man, who ruled his<br />
own spirit, took the cities. He minded his own business and          <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
did the work that no man ever can do unless he gives<br />
absolute loyalty, perfect confidence, and untiring devotion.<br />
</p><p>
Let us mind our own business and work for self by working<br />
for the good of all.<br />

<h2>JOHN MARSHALL OF VIRGINIA</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By John Esten Cooke</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This anecdote about a great American begins with a
short account of his life and work. It goes on to
tell about his appearance and habits and then
relates the story that illustrates something fine
in his character. Judge Marshall was born in 1755
and died in 1835. By recalling what events happened
during his lifetime and what great men were his
contemporaries, you will get a clearer idea of the
setting of the story. In reading it try to picture
costumes, houses, etc.</p></div>


<p>
Among the great men of Virginia, John Marshall<br />
will always be remembered with honor and esteem.<br />
He was the son of a poor man, and his early life was spent<br />
in poverty; but he was not afraid of labor, and everybody<br />
saw that he was a person of more than common ability.     <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
</p><p>
Little by little he rose to distinction, and there was<br />
scarcely any public office in the gift of the people that he<br />
might not have had for the asking. He served in the legislature<br />
of Virginia; he was sent as envoy to France; he was<br />
made Secretary of State; and finally he became Chief     <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
Justice of the United States. When he died at the age of<br />
eighty, he was one of the greatest and most famous men<br />
in America.<br />
</p><p>
My father knew him well and loved him, and told me<br />
many things about him. He was very tall and thin, and    <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
dressed very plainly. He wore a suit of plain black cloth,<br />
and common yarn stockings, which fitted tightly to his legs<br />
and showed how thin they were. He was a very great<br />
walker, and would often walk out to his farm, which was<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>several miles from Richmond. But sometimes he went on<br />
horseback, and once he was met riding out with a bag of<br />
clover seed on the saddle before him.<br />
</p><p>
His manners were plain and simple, and he liked to talk<br />
about everyday matters with plain country people and<br />
laugh and jest with them. In a word, he was so great a man<span class="linenum">5</span><br />
that he never thought of appearing greater than other<br />
people, but was always the same unpretending John<br />
Marshall.<br />
</p><p>
It was the fashion among the gentlemen of Richmond to<br />
walk to market early in the morning and buy fresh meats  <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
and vegetables for their family dinners. This was a good<br />
old fashion, and some famous gentlemen continued to do<br />
so to the end of their lives. It was the habit of Judge<br />
Marshall, and very often he took no servant with him. He<br />
would buy what he wanted and return home, carrying his   <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
purchases on his arm; and on one of these occasions a little<br />
incident occurred which is well worth telling.<br />
</p><p>
Judge Marshall had made his purchases at the market<br />
and was just starting for home when he heard some one<br />
using very rough and unbecoming language. He turned      <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
round and saw what was the cause of the hubbub. A<br />
finely dressed young man, who seemed to be a stranger,<br />
had just bought a turkey in the market. Finding that<br />
it would not be carried home for him, he became very angry.<br />
Judge Marshall listened a moment to his ungentlemanly    <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
talk, and then stepping up to him asked very kindly,<br />
"Where do you live, sir?"<br />
</p><p>
The young man looked at the plainly dressed old countryman,<br />
as he supposed him to be, and then named the street<br />
and number where he lived.                               <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
</p><p>
"I happen to be going that way," said Judge Marshall<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>with a smile, "and I will take it for you."<br />
</p><p>
The young man handed him the turkey and left the<br />
market, followed by Judge Marshall. When they reached<br />
the young man's home, Marshall politely handed him the<br />
turkey and turned to go.<br />
</p><p>
"What shall I pay you?" asked the young man.              <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
</p><p>
"Oh, nothing," answered Marshall. "You are welcome.<br />
It was on my way, and no trouble at all." He bowed and<br />
walked away, while the young man looked after him,<br />
beginning now to see that he had made a mistake.<br />
</p><p>
"Who is that polite old gentleman who carried my turkey  <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
for me?" he asked of a friend who was passing.<br />
</p><p>
"That is John Marshall, Chief Justice of the United<br />
States," was the answer.<br />
</p><p>
The young man was astounded and ashamed. "But<br />
why did he offer to carry my turkey?" he exclaimed.      <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
</p><p>
"To give you a reprimand and teach you to attend to<br />
your own business and behave like a gentleman."<br />
</p><p>
This little anecdote will show you the character of John<br />
Marshall; and I cannot believe that it was his wish merely<br />
to reprimand the foolish young man. He was too sweet-tempered        <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
and kind to take pleasure in reprimanding anyone;<br />
and I have not a doubt that he carried the turkey<br />
simply from the wish to be obliging.<br />
</p>

<h2>OPPORTUNITY</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Edward Rowland Sill</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This poem is an allegory. In reading it try to get
a clear picture of the scene described, and at the
same time remember that everything in it has a
hidden meaning; to understand it fully, you must
find out what the pictures represent. The title
gives you the necessary key.</p></div>


<div>
This I beheld, or dreamed it in a dream:&mdash;<br />
There spread a cloud of dust along a plain;<br />
And underneath the cloud, or in it, raged<br />
A furious battle, and men yelled, and swords<br />
Shocked upon swords and shields. A prince's banner        <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
Wavered, then staggered backward, hemmed by foes.<br />
A craven hung along the battle's edge,<br />
And thought, "Had I a sword of keener steel&mdash;<br />
That blue blade that the king's son bears,&mdash;but this<br />
Blunt thing!" He snapped and flung it from his hand,     <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
And lowering crept away and left the field.<br />
Then came the king's son, wounded, sore bestead,<br />
And weaponless, and saw the broken sword,<br />
Hilt-buried in the dry and trodden sand,<br />
And ran and snatched it, and with battle shout           <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
Lifted afresh, he hewed his enemy down,<br />
And saved a great cause that heroic day.<br />

<h2>JOHN LITTLEJOHN</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Charles Mackay</span></h3>


<div>
John Littlejohn was stanch and strong,<br />
Upright and downright, scorning wrong;<br />
He gave good weight and paid his way,<br />
He thought for himself and said his say.<br />
Whenever a rascal strove to pass,                         <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
Instead of silver, a coin of brass,<br />
He took his hammer and said with a frown,<br />
"The coin is spurious&mdash;nail it down!"<br />
<br />
John Littlejohn was firm and true,<br />
You could not cheat him in "two and two";                <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
When foolish arguers, might and main,<br />
Darkened and twisted the clear and plain,<br />
He saw through the mazes of their speech<br />
The simple truth beyond their reach;<br />
And crushing their logic said with a frown,              <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
"Your coin is spurious&mdash;nail it down!"<br />
<br />
John Littlejohn maintained the right,<br />
Through storm and shine, in the world's despite;<br />
When fools or quacks desired his vote,<br />
Dosed him with arguments learned by rote,                <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
Or by coaxing, threats, or promise tried<br />
To gain his support to the wrong side,<br />

"Your coin is spurious&mdash;nail it down!"<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span><br />
When told that kings had a right divine,<br />
And that the people were herds of swine,<br />

That ceaseless toil was the proper fate                   <span class="linenum">5</span><br />

"Nay, nay," said John with a sigh and frown,             <span class="linenum">15</span><br />

Whenever the world our eyes would blind<br />

<h2>THE DISCONTENTED PENDULUM</h2>


<p>
An old clock that had stood for fifty years in a farmer's<br />
kitchen without giving its owner any cause of complaint,<br />
early one summer's morning, before the family was<br />
stirring, suddenly stopped. Upon this, the dial plate (if<br />
we may credit the fable) changed countenance with alarm;  <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
the hands made a vain effort to continue their course;<br />
the wheels remained motionless with surprise; the weights<br />
hung speechless; and each member felt disposed to lay the<br />
blame on the others. At length the dial instituted a formal<br />
inquiry into the cause of the stoppage; when hands, wheels,          <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
weights, with one voice, protested their innocence. But<br />
now a faint tick was heard below from the pendulum, who<br />
thus spoke:<br />
</p><p>
"I confess myself to be the sole cause of the stoppage;<br />
and I am willing, for the general satisfaction, to assign my         <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
reasons. The truth is, that I am tired of ticking." Upon<br />
hearing this the old clock became so enraged that it was on<br />
the very point of striking.<br />
</p><p>
"Lazy wire!" exclaimed the dial plate, holding up its<br />
hands.                                                   <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
</p><p>
"Very good!" replied the pendulum. "It is vastly<br />
easy for you, Mistress Dial, who have always, as everybody<br />
knows, set yourself up above me&mdash;it is vastly easy for<br />
<i>you</i>, I say, to accuse other people of laziness! You, who<br />
have had nothing to do all your life but to stare people in          <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
the face and to amuse yourself with watching all that goes<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>on in the kitchen! Think how you would like to be shut<br />
up for life in this dark closet and wag backward and forward,<br />
year after year, as I do."<br />
</p><p>
"As to that," said the dial, "is there not a window in<br />
your house on purpose for you to look through?"<br />
</p><p>
"For all that," resumed the pendulum, "it is very dark    <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
here; and although there is a window, I dare not stop, even<br />
for an instant, to look out. Besides I am really tired of my<br />
way of life; and if you wish, I'll tell you how I took this<br />
disgust at my employment. This morning I happened to<br />
be calculating how many times I should have to tick in the           <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
course of only the next twenty-four hours; perhaps some<br />
of you, above there, can give me the exact sum."<br />
</p><p>
The minute hand, being quick at figures, instantly replied,<br />
"Eighty-six thousand four hundred times."<br />
</p><p>
"Exactly so," replied the pendulum. "Well, I appeal to   <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
you all, if the thought of this was not enough to fatigue<br />
one? And when I began to multiply the strokes of one<br />
day by those of months and years, really it is no wonder if<br />
I felt discouraged at the prospect; so after a great deal of<br />
reasoning and hesitation, thinks I to myself, <i>I'll stop!</i>"     <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
</p><p>
The dial could scarcely keep its countenance during this<br />
harangue, but resuming its gravity it at last replied:<br />
"Dear Mr. Pendulum, I am really astonished that such a<br />
useful, industrious person as yourself should have been<br />
overcome by this suggestion. It is true you have done a  <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
great deal of work in your time; so have we all, and are<br />
likely to do; and though this may fatigue us to <i>think</i> of,<br />
the question is, will it fatigue us to <i>do?</i> Would you, now,<br />
give half a dozen strokes to illustrate my argument?"<br />
</p><p>
The pendulum complied, and ticked six times at its       <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
usual pace. "Now," resumed the dial, "may I be allowed<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>to ask, was that exertion at all fatiguing to you?"<br />
</p><p>
"Not in the least," replied the pendulum; "it is not of<br />
six strokes that I complain, nor of sixty, but of <i>millions</i>."<br />
</p><p>
"Very good," replied the dial; "but recollect that although<br />
you may <i>think</i> of a million strokes in an instant, you<br />
are required to execute but one, and that however often   <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
you may hereafter have to swing, a moment will always<br />
be given you to swing in."<br />
</p><p>
"That consideration staggers me, I confess," said the<br />
pendulum.<br />
</p><p>
"Then I hope," resumed the dial plate, "we shall all     <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
immediately return to our duty; for the maids will be in<br />
bed till noon if we stand idling thus."<br />
</p><p>
Upon this the weights, who had never been accused of<br />
light conduct, used all their influence in urging him to<br />
proceed; when, as with one consent, the wheels began to  <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
turn, the hands began to move, the pendulum began to<br />
swing, and, to its credit, ticked as loud as ever; while a<br />
beam of the rising sun that streamed through a hole in the<br />
kitchen shutter, shining full upon the dial plate, made it<br />
brighten up as if nothing had been the matter.           <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
</p><p>
But when the farmer came down to breakfast that morning,<br />
he looked at the clock and declared that his watch<br />
had gained half an hour in the night!<br />

<h2>TWO SIDES TO EVERY QUESTION</h2>


<p>
In the days of knight-errantry and paganism, one of<br />
the old British princes set up a statue to the goddess of<br />
Victory in a point where four roads met together. In her<br />
right hand she held a spear, and her left hand rested upon a<br />
shield. The outside of this shield was of gold and the inside         <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
of silver. On the former was inscribed, in the old British<br />
language, "To the goddess ever favorable"; and on the<br />
other, "For four victories obtained successively over the<br />
Picts and other inhabitants of the northern islands."<br />
</p><p>
It happened one day that two knights completely armed,   <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
one in black armor, the other in white, arrived from opposite<br />
parts of the country at this statue, just about the same time;<br />
and as neither of them had seen it before, they stopped to<br />
read the inscription and to observe its workmanship.<br />
</p><p>
After contemplating it for some time, "This golden       <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
shield&mdash;" said the black knight.<br />
</p><p>
"Golden shield!" cried the white knight (who was as<br />
strictly observing the opposite side); "why, if I have my<br />
eyes, it is silver."<br />
</p><p>
"I know nothing of your eyes," replied the black knight; <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
"but if ever I saw a golden shield in my life, this is one."<br />
</p><p>
"Yes," returned the white knight smiling, "it is very<br />
probable indeed that they should expose a shield of gold in<br />
so public a place as this! For my own part, I wonder that<br />
even a silver one is not too strong a temptation for the <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
devotion of some people who pass this way; and it appears<br />
by the date that this has been here above three years."<br />
</p><p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>The black knight could not bear the smile with which<br />
this was delivered and grew so warm in the dispute that it<br />
soon ended in a challenge; they both, therefore, turned<br />
their horses and rode back so far as to have sufficient space<br />
for their career; then, fixing their spears in their rests<br />
they flew at each other with the greatest fury and impetuosity.       <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
Their shock was so rude, and the blow on each<br />
side so effectual, that they both fell to the ground much<br />
wounded and lay there for some time as in a trance.<br />
</p><p>
A good druid who was traveling that way found them in<br />
this condition. The druids were the physicians of those  <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
times as well as the priests. So he stanched their blood, and<br />
brought them, as it were, from death to life again. As soon<br />
as they were sufficiently recovered he began to inquire into<br />
the cause of their quarrel.<br />
</p><p>
"Why this man," cried the black knight, "will have it    <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
that yonder shield is silver."<br />
</p><p>
"And he will have it," replied the white knight, "that<br />
it is gold."<br />
</p><p>
And then they told him all the particulars of the affair.<br />
</p><p>
"Ah!" said the druid, "my brothers, you are both of you  <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
in the right and both of you in the wrong. Had either<br />
given himself time to look at the opposite side of the shield,<br />
as well as that which first presented itself to view, all this<br />
ill feeling and bloodshed might have been avoided. Allow<br />
me, therefore, to entreat you by all our gods, and by this           <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
goddess of Victory in particular, <i>never again to enter into<br />
any dispute till you have fairly considered both sides of the<br />
question</i>."<br />

<h2>IF I WERE A BOY</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Washington Gladden</span></h3>


<p>
If I were a boy again, and knew what I know now, I<br />
would not be quite so positive in my opinions as I<br />
used to be. Boys generally think that they are very certain<br />
about many things. A boy of fifteen is a great deal<br />
more sure of what he thinks he knows than most men of     <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
fifty. You ask the boy a question and he will answer you<br />
right off, up and down; he knows all about it. Ask a man<br />
of large experience and ripe wisdom the same question,<br />
and he will say, "Well, there is much to be said about it.<br />
I am inclined on the whole to think so and so, but other <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
intelligent men think otherwise."<br />
</p><p>
When I was eight years old, I traveled from central<br />
Massachusetts to western New York, crossing the river at<br />
Albany and going by canal from Schenectady to Syracuse.<br />
On the canal boat, a kindly gentleman was talking to me  <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
one day, and I remarked that I had crossed the Connecticut<br />
River at Albany. How I got it into my head that it was<br />
the Connecticut River I do not know, for I knew my<br />
geography very well then, but in some unaccountable way<br />
I had it fixed in my mind that the river at Albany was the           <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
Connecticut, and I called it so.<br />
</p><p>
"Why," said the gentleman, "that is the Hudson River."<br />
</p><p>
"Oh, no, sir!" I replied politely, but firmly. "You're<br />
mistaken. That is the Connecticut River."<br />
</p><p>
The gentleman smiled and said no more. I was not         <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>much in the habit, I think, of contradicting my elders;<br />
but in this matter I was perfectly sure that I was right and<br />
so I thought it my duty to correct the gentleman's geography.<br />
I felt rather sorry for him that he should be so<br />
ignorant. One day, after I reached home, I was looking<br />
over my route on the map, and lo! there was Albany standing           <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
on the Hudson River, a hundred miles from the Connecticut.<br />
</p><p>
Then I did not feel so sorry for the gentleman's ignorance<br />
as I did for my own. I never told anybody that story<br />
until I wrote it down on these pages the other day; but I<br />
have thought of it a thousand times and always with a    <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
blush for my boldness. Nor was it the only time that I<br />
was perfectly sure of things that really were not so. It is<br />
hard for a boy to learn that he may be mistaken; but unless<br />
he is a fool, he learns it after a while. The sooner he finds<br />
it out, the better for him.                              <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
</p><p>
If I were a boy, I would not think that I and the boys of<br />
my times were an exception to the general rule&mdash;a new<br />
kind of boys, unlike all who have lived before, having<br />
different feelings and different ways. To be honest, I<br />
must own that I used to think so myself. I was quite inclined        <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
to reject the counsel of my elders by saying to myself,<br />
"That may have been well enough for boys thirty or<br />
fifty years ago, but it isn't the thing for me and my set of<br />
boys." Of course that was nonsense. The boys of one<br />
generation are not very different from the boys of any   <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
other generation.<br />
</p><p>
If we say that boyhood lasts fifteen or sixteen years, I<br />
have known three generations of boys, some of them city<br />
boys and some of them country boys, and they are all<br />
substantially alike&mdash;so nearly alike that the old rules of           <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
industry and patience and perseverance and self-control<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>are as applicable to one generation as to another. The<br />
fact is, that what your fathers and teachers have found by<br />
experience to be good for boys will be good for you; and<br />
what their experience has taught them is bad for boys will<br />
be bad for you. You are just boys, nothing more nor less.<br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><br /><p>1. Why would a boy of fifteen be more likely to
"think he knew all about it" than an equally honest
and intelligent man of fifty? Apply to your answer
the preceding story about the two knights. What is
the value of experience?</p>

<p>2. Retell the story of the boy's mistake about the
river. Why was he so ashamed?</p>

<p>3. What is meant by saying that all boys are
substantially alike? What four rules does the
author say are always applicable? Compare the
training of a boy in ancient Sparta and of a page
in medieval times with that of a modern schoolboy.</p></div>

<h2>THE LESSON OF THE WATER MILL</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Sarah Doudney</span></h3>


<div>
Listen to the water mill;<br />
Through the livelong day,<br />
How the clicking of its wheel<br />
Wears the hours away!<br />
Languidly the autumn wind                                 <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
Stirs the forest leaves,<br />
From the field the reapers sing,<br />
Binding up their sheaves;<br />
And a proverb haunts my mind<br />
As a spell is cast,                                      <span class="linenum">10</span><br />

Autumn winds revive no more<br />
Leaves that once are shed,<br />

Corn once gather&egrave;d;<br />
Flows the ruffled streamlet on,                           <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
Tranquil, deep, and still,<br />
Never gliding back again<br />

"The mill cannot grind<br />
With the water that is past."<br />
<br />
Take the lesson to thyself,<br />
True and loving heart!<br />
Golden youth is fleeting by,                             <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
Summer hours depart;<br />
Learn to make the most of life,<br />
Lose no happy day,<br />

Chances swept away!                                      <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
Leave no tender word unsaid,<br />
Love while love shall last;<br />

Never does the streamlet glide<br />
Useless by the mill;<br />

<h2>SAILING AND FAILING</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Hamilton W. Mabie</span></h3>


<p>
There are two kinds of men in the world: those who<br />
sail and those who drift; those who choose the ports<br />
to which they will go and skillfully and boldly shape their<br />
course across the seas, with the wind or against it, and those<br />
who let winds and tides carry them where they will. The   <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
men who sail, in due time arrive; those who drift, often<br />
cover greater distances but they never make port.<br />
</p><p>
The men who sail know where they want to go and<br />
what they want to do; they do not wait on luck or fortune<br />
or favorable currents; they depend on themselves and     <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
expect no help from circumstances. Success of the real<br />
kind is always in the man who wins it, not in conditions.<br />
No man becomes great by accident; great things are never<br />
done by chance; a man gets what he pays for it, in character,<br />
in work, and in energy. A boy would better put           <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
luck out of his mind if he means to accomplish anything.<br />
There are few really fine things which he cannot get if he<br />
is willing to pay the price.<br />
</p><p>
Keep ahead of your work, and your work will push your<br />
fortunes for you. Our employers do not decide whether we <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
shall stay where we are or go on and up; we decide that<br />
matter ourselves. We can drift along, doing our work<br />
fairly well; or we can set our faces to the front and do our<br />
work so well that we cannot be kept back. In this way we<br />
make or mar our own fortunes. Success or failure is not  <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
chosen for us; we choose for ourselves.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span><br />

<h2>USE AND ABUSE OF TIME</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Archer Brown</span></h3>


<p>
Time is the stuff life is made of, says Benjamin Franklin.<br />
Every man has exactly the same amount of<br />
it in a year. One improves it and reaps great results.<br />
Another wastes it and reaps failure. The first class, they<br />
call lucky; the second, unfortunate.                      <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
</p><p>
To use time aright, have a system. Shape everything<br />
to it. Divide the twenty-four hours between work, recreation,<br />
sleep, and mental culture according to a scheme<br />
that suits your judgment and circumstances. Then make<br />
things go that way. The scheme will quickly go to pieces <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
unless backed by persistent purpose.<br />
</p><p>
When you work, work. Put the whole mind and heart<br />
in it. Know nothing else. Do everything the very best.<br />
Distance everybody about you. This will not be hard, for<br />
the other fellows are not trying much. Master details and<span class="linenum">15</span><br />
difficulties. Be always ready for the next step up. If a<br />
bookkeeper, be an expert. If a machinist, know more than<br />
the boss. If an office boy, surprise the employer by model<br />
work. If in school, go to the head and stay there. All this<br />
is easy when the habit of conquering takes possession.   <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
</p><p>
It is wholesome in this connection to read what men<br />
have accomplished who have once learned the art of redeeming<br />
time. Study the causes of the success of Benjamin<br />
Franklin, of Lincoln, of McKinley, of Sir Michael<br />
Faraday, of Agassiz, of Edison. Learn the might of minutes.          <span class="linenum">25</span><br />

day repeated. Those that dare lose a day are dangerously<br />

</p><p>
Sound and wholesome recreation is important in our<br />
scheme; but in this age of athletic frenzy the danger of  <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
neglect on that line is not excessive. The real fact is that<br />
athletic sports are educating the muscles too often at the<br />

</p><p>
It is the mind work that differentiates you from the herd.<br />
Mental culture calls for study&mdash;carefully planned, regular,          <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
persistent. One or two hours a day, aiming at some distinct<br />
object, mastering what you learn, adding little by<br />
little, like a miser to his store, will in a few years make of<br />
you a broad, educated man, no matter what your schooling.<br />
</p><p>
To abuse time, have no system. Chance everything.        <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
Do your work indifferently. Growl if too much is asked.<br />
Hunt for an easy job. Change often. Dodge obstacles.<br />
Always come a little short of the standard. Fritter away<br />
in silly things the few golden moments left for self-culture.<br />
Then you will not crowd anybody very hard in the contest <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
for leadership.<br />

<h2>HIDDEN TREASURE</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Charles Reade</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Charles Reade (1814-1884) was born at Ipsden,
England, and educated at Oxford. He wrote plays and
novels, the latter usually with some purpose of
reform. Compare this story with "Ali Hafed's Quest"
(page 13) as to setting, characters, ending, and
moral.</p></div>


<p>
Once upon a time there was an old farmer that had<br />
heard or read about treasures being found in odd<br />
places&mdash;a potful of gold pieces or something of the sort&mdash;and<br />
it took root in his heart till nothing would satisfy<br />
him but he must find a potful of gold pieces too. He spent<span class="linenum">5</span><br />
all his time hunting in this place and in that for buried<br />
treasures. He poked about all the old ruins in the neighborhood<br />
and even wished to take up the floor of the church.<br />
</p><p>
One morning he arose with a bright face and said to his<br />
wife, "It's all right, Mary. I've found the treasure."   <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
</p><p>
"No! Have you, though?" said she.<br />
</p><p>
"Yes!" he answered; "at least it's as good as found.<br />
It's only waiting till I've had my breakfast, and then I'll<br />
go out and fetch it in."<br />
</p><p>
"Oh, John! How did you find it?"                         <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
</p><p>
"It was revealed to me in a dream," said he, as grave<br />
as a judge.<br />
</p><p>
"Oh! and where is it?"<br />
</p><p>
"Under a tree in our orchard&mdash;no farther than that."<br />
</p><p>
"Oh, how long you are at your breakfast, John! Let's     <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
hurry out and get it."<br />
</p><p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>They went out together into the orchard.<br />
</p><p>
"Now which tree is it under?" asked the wife.<br />
</p><p>
John scratched his head and looked very sheepish. "I'm<br />
blessed if I know!"<br />
</p><p>
"Oh, you foolish fellow," said the wife. "Why didn't<br />
you take the trouble to notice?"                          <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
</p><p>
"I did notice," said he. "I saw the exact tree in my<br />
dream, but now there's so many of them, they muddle<br />
it all."<br />
</p><p>
"Well, I think you're stupid," said the wife angrily.<br />
"You ought to have cut a nick in the right one while you <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
were there."<br />
</p><p>
"That may be," answered John; "but now I see that I'll<br />
have to begin with the first tree and keep on digging till I<br />
come to the one with the treasure under it."<br />
</p><p>
This made the wife lose all hope; for there were eighty  <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
apple trees and a score of cherry trees. She heaved a sigh<br />
and said: "Well, I guess if you must, you must. But<br />
mind you don't cut any of the roots."<br />
</p><p>
John was in no good humor. He abused the trees with<br />
all the bad words he could think of.                     <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
</p><p>
"What difference does it make if I cut all the roots?<br />
The old fagots aren't worth a penny apiece. The whole<br />
lot of them don't bear a bushel of good apples. In father's<br />
time they used to bear wagonloads of choice fruit. I wish<br />
they were every one dead!"                               <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
</p><p>
"Well, John," said the woman, trying to soothe his<br />
anger, "you know that father always gave them a good deal<br />
of attention."<br />
</p><p>
"Attention? Nonsense!" he answered spitefully.<br />
"They don't need attention. They've got old, like ourselves.         <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
They're good for nothing but firewood."<br />
</p><p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>Then, muttering to himself, he brought out pickax and<br />
spade and began his work. He dug three feet deep all<br />
around the first tree, and finding nothing but earth and<br />
stones went on to the next. He heaped up a mound half<br />
as high as his head&mdash;but no pot of gold did he strike.<br />
</p><p>
He had dug round three or four trees before his neighbors <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
began to notice him. Then their curiosity was awakened,<br />
and each one told another about his queer actions. After<br />
that there was scarcely an hour in the day that seven or<br />
eight were not sitting on the fence and passing sly jokes.<br />
Then it became the fashion for the boys to fling a stone or          <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
two or a clod of dry earth at John.<br />
</p><p>
To defend himself, John brought out his gun, loaded with<br />
fine shot, and the next time a stone was thrown he fired<br />
sharp in the direction it came from. The boys took the<br />
hint, and John dug on in peace till the fourth Sunday, when          <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
the parson alluded to him in church. "People ought not<br />
to heap up to themselves treasures on earth."<br />
</p><p>
But it seemed that John was only heaping up dirt; for<br />
when he had dug the fivescore holes, no pot of gold came<br />
to light. Then the neighbors called the orchard "Jacobs's<span class="linenum">20</span><br />
folly"; his name was Jacobs&mdash;John Jacobs.<br />
</p><p>
"Now then, Mary," said he, "you and I will have to<br />
find some other village to live in, for the jokes and gibes<br />
of these people are more than I can bear."<br />
</p><p>
Mary began to cry.                                       <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
</p><p>
"Oh, John, we have been here so long!" she said. "You<br />
brought me here when we were first married. I was just<br />
a lass then, and you were the smartest young man I ever<br />
saw&mdash;at least I thought so."<br />
</p><p>
"Well, Mary," answered John, "I guess we'll try to stay. <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
Perhaps it will all blow over some time."<br />
</p><p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>"Yes, John, it will be like everything else by and by.<br />
But if I were you, I'd fill those holes. The people come<br />
from far and wide on Sundays to see them."<br />
</p><p>
"Mary, I haven't the heart to do that," said the disappointed<br />
man. "You see, when I was digging for treasure<br />
I felt sure I was going to find it, and that kept my heart up.        <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
But take a shovel and fill all those holes? I'd rather do<br />
without eggs every Sunday!"<br />
</p><p>
So for six months the heaps of earth stood in the heat and<br />
the frost. Then in the spring the old man took heart and<br />
filled the holes, smoothing the ground until it was as level         <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
as before. And soon everybody forgot "Jacobs's folly"<br />
because it was out of sight.<br />
</p><p>
The month of April was warm, and out burst the trees.<br />
"Mary," said John, "the bloom is richer than I've seen<br />
it for many a year; it's a good deal richer than in any of           <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
our neighbors' orchards."<br />
</p><p>
The bloom died, and then out came a million little green<br />
things, quite hard. Summer passed. Autumn followed,<br />
and the old trees staggered under their weight of fruit.<br />
</p><p>
The trees were old and needed attention. John's          <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
letting in the air to them and turning the soil up to the<br />
frost and sun had renewed their youth. And so, in that<br />
way, he learned that tillage is the way to get treasure<br />
from the earth.<br />

<h2>THE SOLITARY REAPER</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By William Wordsworth</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A friend of Wordsworth's, while traveling in the
Highlands of Scotland, was impressed by the
beautiful singing voice of a girl whom he saw
working alone in a field; he wrote in his
diary&mdash;"the sweetest human voice I ever heard. The
strains felt delicious long after they were heard
no more." Wordsworth had traveled through the same
country, and from the note and his own impressions
he built up this poem. The first stanza gives the
real picture, the second offers two
comparisons&mdash;the nightingale and the cuckoo&mdash;one
sad, the other happy, both associated with solitude
and open spaces. The third stanza relates the girl
and her song to the background of history and human
experience that belongs to the scene; and the last
refers to Wordsworth's delight in recalling
beautiful things.</p></div>

<div>
Behold her, single in the field,<br />
Yon solitary Highland lass!<br />
Reaping and singing by herself;<br />
Stop here, or gently pass!<br />
Alone she cuts and binds the grain,                       <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
And sings a melancholy strain;<br />
O listen! for the vale profound<br />
Is overflowing with the sound.<br />
<br />
No nightingale did ever chant<br />
More welcome notes to weary bands                        <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
Of travelers in some shady haunt<br />
Among Arabian sands;<br />
A voice so thrilling ne'er was heard<br />
In springtime from the cuckoo bird,<br />
Breaking the silence of the seas                         <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
Among the farthest Hebrides.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span><br />
Will no one tell me what she sings?<br />
Perhaps the plaintive numbers flow<br />
For old, unhappy, far-off things,<br />
And battles long ago;<br />
Or is it some more humble lay,                            <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
Familiar matter of to-day&mdash;<br />
Some natural sorrow, loss, or pain,<br />
That has been and may be again?<br />
<br />
Whate'er the theme, the maiden sang<br />
As if her song could have no ending;                     <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
I saw her singing at her work<br />
And o'er the sickle bending;<br />
I listened, motionless and still,<br />
And as I mounted up the hill,<br />
The music in my heart I bore                             <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
Long after it was heard no more.<br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><br /><p>1. Describe what is seen and heard. To what bird
songs is the girl's voice compared? Have you ever
heard the song of the nightingale? What widely
different places are thought of in the second
stanza? What have the desert and the sea in common?
Where are the Hebrides?</p>

<p>2. Explain: numbers, lay, sickle, lass, vale,
profound.</p>

<p>3. What in this poem reminds you of "The
Daffodils?" How is the theme identical with
Longfellow's "The Arrow and the Song?"</p></div>

<h2>THE STAGECOACH</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Mark Twain</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Before the days of the railroad, the lumbering,
horse-drawn stagecoach was the general vehicle used
for cross-country passenger travel. Following the
Civil War, the brother of Mark Twain (Samuel L.
Clemens) was appointed Territorial Secretary of
Nevada. Samuel accompanied his brother as private
secretary. The journey was made largely in a
stagecoach, the inconveniences of which are
whimsically set forth in the following extract from
Twain's <i>Roughing It</i>.</p></div>


<p>
As the sun went down and the evening chill came on,<br />
we made preparation for bed. We stirred up the<br />
hard leather letter sacks, and the knotty canvas bags of<br />
printed matter (knotty and uneven because of projecting<br />
ends and corners of magazines, boxes, and books). We      <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
stirred them up and redisposed them in such a way as to<br />
make our bed as level as possible. And we did improve<br />
it, too, though after all our work it had an upheaved<br />
and billowy look about it, like a little piece of a stormy<br />
sea. Next we hunted up our boots from odd nooks among    <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
the mail bags where they had settled, and put them on.<br />
</p><p>
Then we got down our coats, vests, pantaloons, and heavy<br />
woolen shirts, from the arm loops where they had been<br />
swinging all day, and clothed ourselves in them&mdash;for,<br />
there being no ladies either at the stations or in the coach,        <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
and the weather being hot, we had looked to our comfort<br />
by stripping to our underclothing at nine o'clock in the<br />
morning. All things being now ready, we stowed the uneasy<br />
Dictionary where it would lie as quiet as possible and<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>placed the water canteen and pistols where we could find <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
them in the dark. Then we smoked a final pipe and<br />
swapped a final yarn; after which we put the pipes, tobacco,<br />
and bag of coin in snug holes and caves among the mail<br />
bags, and then fastened down the coach curtains all around,<br />
and made the place as "dark as the inside of a cow," as   <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
the conductor phrased it in his picturesque way. It was<br />
certainly as dark as any place could be&mdash;nothing was even<br />
dimly visible in it. And finally we rolled ourselves up like<br />
silkworms, each person in his own blanket, and sank peacefully<br />
to sleep.                                                <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
</p><p>
Whenever the stage stopped to change horses we would<br />
wake up, and try to recollect where we were&mdash;-and succeed&mdash;and<br />
in a minute or two the stage would be off again,<br />
and we likewise. We began to get into country now,<br />
threaded here and there with little streams. These had   <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
high, steep banks on each side, and every time we flew<br />
down one bank and scrambled up the other, our party<br />
inside got mixed somewhat. First we would all be down<br />
in a pile at the forward end of the stage, nearly in a sitting<br />
posture, and in a second we would shoot to the other end <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
and stand on our heads. And we would sprawl and kick,<br />
too, and ward off ends and corners of mail bags that came<br />
lumbering over us and about us; and as the dust rose<br />
from the tumult, we would all sneeze in chorus, and the<br />
majority of us would grumble, and probably say some hasty<span class="linenum">25</span><br />
thing, like, "Take your elbow out of my ribs!&mdash;can't you<br />
quit crowding?"<br />
</p><p>
Every time we avalanched from one end of the stage to<br />
the other, the Unabridged Dictionary would come too;<br />
and every time it came it damaged somebody. One trip     <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
it "barked" the Secretary's elbow; the next trip it hurt<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>me in the stomach; and the third it tilted Bemis's nose<br />
up till he could look down his nostrils&mdash;he said. The<br />
pistols and coin soon settled to the bottom, but the pipes,<br />
pipestems, tobacco, and canteens clattered and floundered<br />
after the Dictionary every time it made an assault on us,<br />
and aided and abetted the book by spilling tobacco in     <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
our eyes and water down our backs.<br />
</p><p>
Still, all things considered, it was a very comfortable<br />
night. It wore gradually away, and when at last a cold,<br />
gray light was visible through the puckers and chinks in<br />
the curtains, we yawned and stretched with satisfaction, <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
shed our cocoons, and felt that we had slept as much as was<br />
necessary. By and by, as the sun rose up and warmed the<br />
world, we pulled off our clothes and got ready for breakfast.<br />
We were just pleasantly in time, for five minutes afterward<br />
the driver sent the weird music of his bugle winding over<span class="linenum">15</span><br />
the grassy solitudes, and presently we detected a low hut<br />
or two in the distance. Then the rattling of the coach, the<br />
clatter of our six horses' hoofs, and the driver's crisp commands,<br />
awoke to a louder and stronger emphasis, and we<br />
went sweeping down on the station at our smartest speed. <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
It was fascinating&mdash;that old Overland stagecoaching.<br />
</p><p>
We jumped out in undress uniform. The driver tossed<br />
his gathered reins out on the ground, gaped and stretched<br />
complacently, drew off his heavy buckskin gloves with<br />
great deliberation and insufferable dignity&mdash;taking not  <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
the slightest notice of a dozen solicitous inquiries after his<br />
health, and humbly facetious and flattering accostings, and<br />
obsequious tenders of service, from five or six hairy and<br />
half-civilized station keepers and hostlers who were nimbly<br />
unhitching our steeds and bringing the fresh team out of the         <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
stables&mdash;for in the eyes of the stage driver of that day,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>station keepers and hostlers were a sort of good-enough low<br />
creatures, useful in their place and helping to make up a<br />
world, but not the kind of beings which a person of distinction<br />
could afford to concern himself with; while on the<br />
contrary, in the eyes of the station keeper and the hostler,<br />
the stage driver was a hero&mdash;a great and shining dignitary;           <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
the world's favorite son, the envy of the people, the observed<br />
of the nations.<br />
</p><p>
When they spoke to him they received his insolent<br />
silence meekly and as being the natural and proper<br />
conduct of so great a man; when he opened his lips       <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
they all hung on his words with admiration (he never<br />
honored a particular individual with a remark, but addressed<br />
it with a broad generality to the horses, the stables,<br />
the surrounding country, and the human underlings); when<br />
he discharged a facetious insulting personality at a hostler,        <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
that hostler was happy for the day; when he uttered his<br />
one jest&mdash;old as the hills, coarse, profane, witless, and inflicted<br />
on the same audience, in that same language, every<br />
time his coach drove up there&mdash;the varlets roared, and<br />
slapped their thighs, and swore it was the best thing they'd         <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
ever heard in all their lives. And how they would fly<br />
around when he wanted a basin of water, a gourd of the same,<br />
or a light for his pipe!&mdash;but they would instantly insult<br />
a passenger if he so far forgot himself as to crave a favor<br />
at their hands. They could do that sort of insolence as  <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
well as the driver they copied it from&mdash;for, let it be borne<br />
in mind, the Overland driver had but little less contempt<br />
for his passengers than he had for his hostlers.<br />
</p><p>
The hostlers and station keepers treated the really<br />
powerful conductor of the coach merely with the best     <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
of what was their idea of civility, but the driver was the<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>only being they bowed down to and worshiped. How<br />
admiringly they would gaze up at him in his high seat as<br />
he gloved himself with lingering deliberation, while some<br />
happy hostler held the bunch of reins aloft and waited<br />
patiently for him to take it! And how they would bombard<br />
him with glorifying ejaculations as he cracked his long whip          <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
and went careering away.<br />
</p><p>
The station buildings were long, low huts, made of sun-dried,<br />
mud-colored bricks, laid up without mortar (<i>adobes</i>,<br />
the Spaniards call these bricks, and Americans shorten it<br />
to <i>'dobies</i>). The roofs, which had no slant to them worth      <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
speaking of, were thatched and then sodded, or covered<br />
with a thick layer of earth, and from this sprang a pretty<br />
rank growth of weeds and grass. It was the first time we<br />
had ever seen a man's front yard on top of his house. The<br />
buildings consisted of barns, stable room for twelve or  <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
fifteen horses, and a hut for an eating room for passengers.<br />
This latter had bunks in it for the station keeper and a hostler<br />
or two. You could rest your elbow on its eaves, and<br />
you had to bend in order to get in at the door. In place<br />
of a window there was a square hole about large enough   <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
for a man to crawl through, but this had no glass in it.<br />
There was no flooring, but the ground was packed hard.<br />
There were no shelves, no cupboards, no closets. In a<br />
corner stood an open sack of flour, and nestling against its<br />
base were a couple of black and venerable tin coffeepots,<span class="linenum">25</span><br />
a tin teapot, a little bag of salt, and a side of bacon.<br />
</p><p>
By the door of the station keeper's den, outside, was a<br />
tin washbasin, on the ground. Near it was a pail of water<br />
and a piece of yellow bar soap, and from the eaves hung a<br />
hoary blue-woolen shirt, significantly&mdash;but this latter was          <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
the station keeper's private towel, and only two persons<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>in all the party might venture to use it&mdash;the stage driver<br />
and the conductor. The latter would not, from a sense of<br />
decency; the former would not, because he did not choose<br />
to encourage the advances of a station keeper. We had<br />
towels&mdash;in the valise; they might as well have been in<br />
Sodom and Gomorrah.                                       <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
</p><p>
We (and the conductor) used our handkerchiefs, and<br />
the driver his pantaloons and sleeves. By the door, inside,<br />
was fastened a small old-fashioned looking-glass<br />
frame, with two little fragments of the original mirror<br />
lodged down in one corner of it. This arrangement afforded           <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
a pleasant double-barreled portrait of you when you<br />
looked into it, with one half of your head set up a couple<br />
of inches above the other half. From the glass frame hung<br />
the half a comb by a string&mdash;but if I had to describe that<br />
patriarch or die, I believe I would order some sample    <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
coffins. It had come down from Esau and Samson, and<br />
had been accumulating hair ever since&mdash;along with<br />
certain impurities. In one corner of the room stood three<br />
or four rifles and muskets, together with horns and pouches<br />
of ammunition.                                           <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
</p><p>
The station men wore pantaloons of coarse country-woven<br />
stuff, and into the seat and the inside of the<br />
legs were sewed ample additions of buckskin to do duty<br />
in place of leggings when the man rode horseback&mdash;so<br />
the pants were half dull blue and half yellow, and       <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
unspeakably picturesque. The pants were stuffed into<br />
the tops of high boots, the heels whereof were armed with<br />
great Spanish spurs whose little iron clogs and chains<br />
jingled with every step. The man wore a huge beard and<br />
mustachios, an old slouch hat, a blue-woolen shirt, no   <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
suspenders, no vest, no coat; in a leathern sheath in his<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>belt, a great long "navy" revolver (slung on right side,<br />
hammer to the front), and projecting from his boot a horn-handled<br />
bowie knife. The furniture of the hut was neither<br />
gorgeous nor much in the way. The rocking-chairs and<br />
sofas were not present and never had been, but they were<br />
represented by two three-legged stools, a pine-board bench<span class="linenum">5</span><br />
four feet long, and two empty candle boxes. The table<br />
was a greasy board on stilts, and the tablecloth and napkins<br />
had not come&mdash;and they were not looking for them, either.<br />
A battered tin platter, a knife and fork, and a tin pint cup,<br />
were at each man's place, and the driver had a queen's-ware          <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
saucer that had seen better days. Of course this<br />
duke sat at the head of the table.<br />
</p><p>
There was one isolated piece of table furniture that bore<br />
about it a touching air of grandeur in misfortune. This was<br />
the caster. It was German silver and crippled and rusty, <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
but it was so preposterously out of place there that it<br />
was suggestive of a tattered exiled king among barbarians,<br />
and the majesty of its native position compelled respect<br />
even in its degradation. There was only one cruet left,<br />
and that was a stopperless, fly-specked, broken-necked   <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
thing, with two inches of vinegar in it and a dozen preserved<br />
flies with their heels up and looking sorry they<br />
had invested there.<br />
</p><p>
The station keeper upended a disk of last week's bread,<br />
of the shape and size of an old-time cheese, and carved some         <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
slabs from it which were as good as Nicholson pavement,<br />
and tenderer.<br />
</p><p>
He sliced off a piece of bacon for each man, but only the<br />
experienced old hands made out to eat it, for it was condemned<br />
army bacon which the United States would not feed        <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
to its soldiers in the forts, and the stage company had<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>bought it cheap for the sustenance of their passengers and<br />
employees. We may have found this condemned army<br />
bacon further out on the plains than the section I am locating<br />
it in, but we <i>found</i> it&mdash;there is no gainsaying that.<br />
</p><p>
Then he poured for us a beverage which he called <i>slumgullion</i><br />
and it is hard to think he was not inspired when          <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
he named it. It really pretended to be tea, but there was<br />
too much dishrag, and sand, and old bacon rind in it to<br />
deceive the intelligent traveler. He had no sugar and no<br />
milk&mdash;not even a spoon to stir the ingredients with.<br />
</p><p>
We could not eat the bread or the meat, or drink the     <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
"slumgullion." And when I looked at that melancholy<br />
vinegar cruet, I thought of the anecdote (a very, very old<br />
one, even at that day) of the traveler who sat down at a<br />
table which had nothing on it but a mackerel and a pot<br />
of mustard. He asked the landlord if this was all. The   <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
landlord said:<br />
</p><p>
"<i>All!</i> Why, thunder and lightning, I should think<br />
there was mackerel enough there for six."<br />
</p><p>
"But I don't like mackerel."<br />
</p><p>
"Oh&mdash;then help yourself to the mustard."                 <span class="linenum">20</span><br />

<h2>THE CHAMELEON</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By James Merrick</span></h3>


<div>
Two travelers of conceited cast,<br />
As o'er Arabia's wilds they passed,<br />
And on their way, in friendly chat,<br />
Now talked of this and then of that,<br />
Discoursed awhile 'mongst other matter                    <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
Of the chameleon's form and nature.<br />
<br />
"A stranger animal," cries one,<br />
"Sure never lived beneath the sun;<br />
A lizard's body, lean and long;<br />
A fish's head; a serpent's tongue;                       <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
Its foot with triple claw disjoined;<br />
And what a length of tail behind!<br />
How slow its pace! And then its hue!&mdash;<br />
Who ever saw so fine a blue?"<br />
<br />
"Hold, there!" the other quick replies;                  <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
"'Tis <i>green</i>&mdash;I saw it with these eyes,<br />
As late with open mouth it lay,<br />
And warmed it in the sunny ray;<br />
Stretched at its ease, the beast I viewed,<br />
And saw it eat the air for food."                        <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
<br />
"I've seen it, sir, as well as you,<br />
And must again affirm it blue.<br />
At leisure I the beast surveyed,<br />
Extended in the cooling shade."<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span><br />
"'Tis green, 'tis green, sir, I assure ye."<br />
"Green!" cries the other in a fury;<br />
"Why, sir, d'ye think I've lost my eyes?"<br />
"'Twere no great loss," the friend replies,<br />
"For if they always serve you thus,                       <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
You'll find them of but little use."<br />
<br />
So high at last the contest rose,<br />
From words they almost came to blows;<br />
When luckily came by a third&mdash;<br />
To him the question they referred,                       <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
And begged he'd tell them, if he knew,<br />
Whether the thing was green, or blue.<br />
<br />
"Sirs," cries the umpire, "cease your pother!<br />
The creature's neither one nor t'other.<br />
I caught the animal last night,                          <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
And viewed it o'er by candle light;<br />
I marked it well&mdash;'twas black as jet;<br />
You stare&mdash;but, sirs, I've got it yet,<br />
And can produce it." "Pray, sir, do;<br />
I'll lay my life the thing is blue."                     <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
"And I'll engage that when you've seen<br />
The reptile, you'll pronounce him green."<br />
<br />
"Well, then, at once to ease the doubt,"<br />
Replies the man, "I'll turn him out;<br />
And when before your eyes I've set him,                  <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
If you don't find him black, I'll eat him."<br />
He said: then full before their sight<br />
Produced the beast, and lo&mdash;'twas white!<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span><br />
Both stared; the man looked wondrous wise!&mdash;<br />
"My children," the chameleon cries<br />
(Then first the creature found a tongue),<br />
"You all are right, and all are wrong,<br />
When next you talk of what you view,                      <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
Think others see as well as you;<br />
Nor wonder if you find that none<br />
Prefers your eyesight to his own."<br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><br /><p>1. You should read with this poem Saxe's "The Blind
Men and the Elephant." Is it like any other
selection you have read?</p>

<p>2. Does the chameleon actually change color?
Wherein does the humor of the poem lie?</p></div>

<h2>THE PICKWICK CLUB ON ICE</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Charles Dickens</span></h3>


<p>
"Now," said Wardle, after a substantial lunch had<br />
been done ample justice to, "what say you to an<br />
hour on the ice? We shall have plenty of time."<br />
</p><p>
"Capital," said Mr. Benjamin Allen.<br />
</p><p>
"Prime," ejaculated Mr. Bob Sawyer.                       <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
</p><p>
"You skate, of course, Winkle?" said Wardle.<br />
</p><p>
"Ye&mdash;yes; oh, yes!" replied Mr. Winkle. "I&mdash;I&mdash;am<br />
rather out of practice."<br />
</p><p>
"Oh, do skate, Mr. Winkle," said Arabella. "I like to<br />
see it so much."                                         <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
</p><p>
"Oh, it is so graceful," said another young lady.<br />
</p><p>
A third young lady said it was "elegant," and a fourth expressed<br />
her opinion that it was "swanlike."<br />
</p><p>
"I should be very happy, I'm sure," said Mr. Winkle,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>reddening; "but I have no skates."                       <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
</p><p>
This objection was at once overruled. Trundle had a<br />
couple of pair, and the fat boy announced that there were<br />
half a dozen more in the house; whereat Mr. Winkle expressed<br />
exquisite delight and looked exquisitely uncomfortable.   <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
</p><p>
Mr. Winkle, with his face and hands blue with the cold,<br />
forced a gimlet into the soles of his feet, put his skates on<br />
with the points behind, and got the straps into a very<br />
complicated and entangled state, with the assistance of<br />
Mr. Snodgrass, who knew rather less about skates than a  <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
Hindu. At length, however, with the assistance of Mr.<br />
Weller, the unfortunate skates were firmly screwed and<br />
buckled on, and Mr. Winkle was raised to his feet.<br />
</p><p>
"Now, then, sir," said Sam in an encouraging tone; "off<br />
with you, and show 'em how to do it."                    <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
</p><p>
"Stop, Sam, stop," said Mr. Winkle, trembling violently<br />
and clutching hold of Sam's arm with the grasp of a drowning<br />
man. "How slippery it is, Sam."<br />
</p><p>
"Not an uncommon thing upon ice, sir," replied Mr.<br />
Weller. "Hold up, sir."                                  <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
</p><p>
This last observation of Mr. Weller's bore reference to a<br />
demonstration Mr. Winkle made at the instant, of a frantic<br />
desire to throw his feet in the air and dash the back of his<br />
head on the ice.<br />
</p><p>
"These&mdash;these&mdash;are very awkward skates, ain't they,      <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
Sam?" inquired Mr. Winkle, staggering.<br />
</p><p>
"I'm afraid there's an awkward gentleman in 'em, sir,"<br />
replied Sam.<br />
</p><p>
"Now, Winkle," cried Mr. Pickwick, quite unconscious<br />
that there was anything the matter. "Come, the ladies    <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
are all anxiety."<br />
</p><p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>"Yes, yes!" replied Mr. Winkle with a ghastly smile.<br />
</p><p>
"Just a goin' to begin," said Sam, endeavoring to disengage<br />
himself. "Now, sir, start off."<br />
</p><p>
"Stop an instant, Sam," gasped Mr. Winkle, clinging<br />
most affectionately to Mr. Weller. "I find I've got a<br />
couple of coats at home that I don't want, Sam. You may   <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
have them, Sam."<br />
</p><p>
"Thank'ee, sir," replied Mr. Weller.<br />
</p><p>
"Never mind touching your hat, Sam," said Mr. Winkle<br />
hastily. "You needn't take your hand away to do that.<br />
I meant to have given you five shillings this morning for a          <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
Christmas box, Sam; I'll give it to you this afternoon,<br />
Sam."<br />
</p><p>
"You're very good, sir," replied Mr. Weller.<br />
</p><p>
"Just hold me at first, Sam, will you?" said Mr. Winkle.<br />
"There&mdash;that's right. I shall soon get in the way of it, <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
Sam. Not too fast, Sam; not too fast."<br />
</p><p>
Mr. Winkle, stooping forward with his body half doubled<br />
up, was being assisted over the ice by Mr. Weller in a very<br />
singular and unswanlike manner when Mr. Pickwick most<br />
innocently shouted from the opposite bank,               <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
</p><p>
"Sam!"<br />
</p><p>
"Sir?" said Mr. Weller.<br />
</p><p>
"Here. I want you."<br />
</p><p>
"Let go, sir," said Sam. "Don't you hear the governor<br />
a callin'? Let go, sir."                                 <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
</p><p>
With a violent effort Mr. Weller disengaged himself from<br />
the grasp of the agonized Pickwickian; and in so doing<br />
administered a considerable impetus to the unhappy Mr.<br />
Winkle. With an accuracy which no degree of dexterity or<br />
practice could have insured, that gentleman bore swiftly <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
down into the center of a group at the very moment when<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>Mr. Bob Sawyer was performing a flourish of unparalleled<br />
beauty. Mr. Winkle struck wildly against him, and with a<br />
wild crash they fell heavily down. Mr. Pickwick ran to the<br />
spot. Bob Sawyer had risen to his feet, but Mr. Winkle<br />
was far too wise to do anything of the kind in skates. He<br />
was seated on the ice, making spasmodic efforts to smile; <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
but anguish was depicted on every lineament of his countenance.<br />
</p><p>
Mr. Pickwick was excited and indignant. He beckoned<br />
to Mr. Weller and said in a stern voice, "Take his skates<br />
off."                                                    <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
</p><p>
"No; but really I had scarcely begun," remonstrated<br />
Mr. Winkle.<br />
</p><p>
"Take his skates off," repeated Mr. Pickwick firmly.<br />
</p><p>
The command was not to be resisted. Mr. Winkle<br />
allowed Sam to obey it in silence.                       <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
</p><p>
"Lift him up," said Mr. Pickwick. Sam assisted him<br />
to rise.<br />
</p><p>
Mr. Pickwick retired a few paces apart from the bystanders,<br />
and beckoning his friend to approach, fixed a<br />
searching look upon him and uttered in a low but distinct<span class="linenum">20</span><br />
and emphatic tone these remarkable words:<br />
</p><p>
"You're a humbug, sir."<br />
</p><p>
"A what?" said Mr. Winkle, starting.<br />
</p><p>
"A humbug, sir. I will speak plainer if you wish it.<br />
An impostor, sir."                                       <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
</p><p>
With these words, Mr. Pickwick turned slowly on his<br />
heel and rejoined his friends.<br />
</p><p>
While Mr. Pickwick was delivering himself of the sentiment<br />
just recorded, Mr. Weller and the fat boy, having by<br />
their joint endeavors cut out a slide, were exercising themselves    <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
thereupon in a very masterly and brilliant manner.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>Sam Weller, in particular, was displaying that beautiful<br />
feat of fancy sliding which is currently denominated "knocking<br />
at the cobbler's door," and which is achieved by skimming<br />
over the ice on one foot and occasionally giving a two-penny<br />
postman's knock upon it with the other. It was<br />
a good long slide, and there was something in the motion  <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
which Mr. Pickwick, who was very cold with standing still,<br />
could not help envying.<br />
</p><p>
"It looks a nice warm exercise, that, doesn't it?" he<br />
inquired of Wardle, when that gentleman was thoroughly<br />
out of breath by reason of the indefatigable manner in   <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
which he had converted his legs into a pair of compasses<br />
and drawn complicated problems on the ice.<br />
</p><p>
"Ah, it does, indeed," replied Wardle. "Do you slide?"<br />
</p><p>
"I used to do so, on the gutters, when I was a boy,"<br />
replied Mr. Pickwick.                                    <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
</p><p>
"Try it now," said Wardle.<br />
</p><p>
Mr. Pickwick paused, considered, pulled off his gloves<br />
and put them in his hat, took two or three short runs,<br />
balked himself as often, and at last took another run and<br />
went slowly and gravely down the slide with his feet about           <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
a yard and a quarter apart, amidst the gratified shouts of<br />
all the spectators.<br />
</p><p>
It was the most intensely interesting thing to observe<br />
the manner in which Mr. Pickwick performed his share<br />
in the ceremony; to watch the torture of anxiety with    <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
which he viewed the person behind, gaining upon him at<br />
the imminent hazard of tripping him up; to see him<br />
gradually expend the painful force which he had put on<br />
at first and turn slowly round on the slide, with his face<br />
towards the point from which he had started; to contemplate          <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
the playful smile which mantled on his face when he had<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>accomplished the distance and the eagerness with which he<br />
turned round when he had done so and ran after his predecessor,<br />
his black gaiters tripping pleasantly through<br />
the snow and his eyes beaming cheerfulness and gladness<br />
through his spectacles. And when he was knocked down<br />
(which happened upon the average every third round),      <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
it was the most invigorating sight that can possibly be<br />
imagined to behold him gather up his hat, gloves, and<br />
handkerchief with a glowing countenance, and resume<br />
his station in the rank with an ardor and enthusiasm which<br />
nothing could abate.                                     <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
</p><p>
The sport was at its height, the sliding was at the quickest,<br />
the laughter was at the loudest, when a sharp, smart<br />
crack was heard. There was a quick rush towards the bank,<br />
a wild scream from the ladies, and a shout from Mr. Tupman.<br />
A large mass of ice disappeared, the water bubbled       <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
up over it, and Mr. Pickwick's hat, gloves, and handkerchief<br />
were floating on the surface; and this was all of Mr.<br />
Pickwick that anybody could see.<br />
</p><p>
Dismay and anguish were depicted on every countenance;<br />
the males turned pale, and the females fainted; Mr. Snodgrass        <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
and Mr. Winkle grasped each other by the hand and<br />
gazed at the spot where their leader had gone down, with<br />
frenzied eagerness; while Mr. Tupman, by way of rendering<br />
the promptest assistance and at the same time conveying<br />
to any persons who might be within hearing the clearest  <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
possible notion of the catastrophe, ran off across the country<br />
at his utmost speed, screaming "Fire!" with all his<br />
might and main.<br />
</p><p>
It was at this very moment&mdash;when old Wardle and Sam<br />
Weller were approaching the hole with cautious steps and <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
Mr. Benjamin Allen was holding a hurried consultation<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>with Mr. Bob Sawyer on the advisability of bleeding the<br />
company generally, as an improving little bit of professional<br />
practice&mdash;it was at this very moment that a head, face,<br />
and shoulders emerged from beneath the water, and disclosed<br />
the features and spectacles of Mr. Pickwick.<br />
</p><p>
"Do you feel the bottom there, old fellow?" said Wardle.  <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
</p><p>
"Yes, certainly," replied Mr. Pickwick, wringing the<br />
water from his head and face and gasping for breath. "I<br />
fell upon my back. I couldn't get on my feet at first."<br />
</p><p>
The clay upon so much of Mr. Pickwick's coat as was yet<br />
visible bore testimony to the accuracy of this statement;<span class="linenum">10</span><br />
and as the fears of the spectators were still further relieved<br />
by the fat boy's suddenly recollecting that the water was<br />
nowhere more than five feet deep, prodigies of valor were<br />
performed to get him out. After a vast quantity of splashing,<br />
and cracking, and struggling, Mr. Pickwick was at        <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
length fairly extricated from his unpleasant position and<br />
once more stood on dry land.<br />

<h2>DARIUS GREEN AND HIS FLYING MACHINE</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By John Townsend Trowbridge</span></h3>


<div>
If ever there lived a Yankee lad,<br />
Wise or otherwise, good or bad,<br />
Who, seeing the birds fly, didn't jump<br />
With flapping arms from stake or stump,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or spreading the tail</span><span class="linenum">5</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of his coat for a sail,</span><br />
Take a soaring leap from post or rail,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And wonder why</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>He</i> couldn't fly,</span><br />
And flap and flutter and wish and try&mdash;                  <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
If ever you knew a country dunce<br />
Who didn't try that as often as once&mdash;<br />
All I can say is, that's a sign<br />
He never would do for a hero of mine.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span><br />
An aspiring genius was D. Green:                         <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
The son of a farmer&mdash;age fourteen;<br />
His body was long and lank and lean&mdash;<br />
Just right for flying, as will be seen;<br />
He had two eyes as bright as a bean,<br />
And a freckled nose that grew between,                   <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
A little awry;&mdash;for I must mention<br />
That he had riveted his attention<br />
Upon his wonderful invention,<br />
Twisting his tongue as he twisted the strings,<br />
And working his face as he worked the wings,             <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
And with every turn of gimlet and screw<br />
Turning and screwing his mouth round too,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till his nose seemed bent</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To catch the scent,</span><br />
Around some corner, of new-baked pies,<br />
And his wrinkled cheeks and squinting eyes                <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
Grew puckered into a queer grimace,<br />
That made him look very droll in the face,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And also very wise.</span><br />
<br />
And wise he must have been, to do more<br />
Than ever a genius did before,                           <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
Excepting D&aelig;dalus of yore,<br />
And his son Icarus, who wore<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon their backs</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Those wings of wax</span><br />
He had read of in the old almanacs.                      <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
Darius was clearly of the opinion,<br />
That the air was also man's dominion,<br />
And that, with paddle or fin or pinion,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We soon or late</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shall navigate</span><span class="linenum">20</span><br />
The azure as now we sail the sea.<br />
The thing looks simple enough to me;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And if you doubt it,</span><br />
Hear how Darius reasoned about it:<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"The birds can fly,</span><span class="linenum">25</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">An' why can't I?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Must we give in,"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Says he with a grin,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"That the bluebird an' phoebe</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are smarter 'n we be?</span><span class="linenum">30</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>Jest fold our hands an' see the swaller<br />
An' blackbird an' catbird beat us holler?<br />
Does the leetle chatterin', sassy wren,<br />
No bigger'n my thumb, know more than men?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Jest show me that</span><span class="linenum">5</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Er prove 't the bat</span><br />
Hez got more brains than's in my hat,<br />
An' I'll back down, an' not till then!"<br />
<br />
He argued further: "Ner I can't see<br />
What's th' use o' wings to a bumblebee                   <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
Fer to git a livin' with, more'n to me;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ain't my business</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Importanter'n his'n is?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That Icarus</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Made a perty muss&mdash;</span><span class="linenum">15</span><br />
Him an' his daddy Daedalus.<br />
They might 'a' knowed wings made o' wax<br />
Wouldn't stan' sun heat an' hard whacks:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I'll make mine o' luther,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Er suthin' er other."</span><span class="linenum">20</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span><br />
And he said to himself, as he tinkered and planned:<br />
"But I ain't goin' to show my hand<br />
To nummies that never can understand<br />
The fust idee that's big an' grand."<br />
So he kept his secret from all the rest,                 <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
Safely buttoned within his vest;<br />
And in the loft above the shed<br />
Himself he locks, with thimble and thread<br />
And wax and hammer and buckles and screws,<br />
And all such things as geniuses use:                     <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
Two bats for patterns, curious fellows!<br />
A charcoal pot and a pair of bellows;<br />
An old hoop skirt or two, as well as<br />
Some wire and several old umbrellas;<br />
A carriage cover for tail and wings;                      <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
A piece of harness; and straps and strings;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And a big, strong box,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In which he locks</span><br />
These and a hundred other things.<br />
<br />
His grinning brothers, Reuben and Burke                  <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
And Nathan and Jotham and Solomon, lurk<br />
Around the corner to see him work&mdash;<br />
Sitting cross-legged, like a Turk,<br />
Drawing the waxed end through with a jerk,<br />
And boring the holes with a comical quirk                <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
Of his wise old head, and a knowing smirk.<br />
But vainly they mounted each other's backs,<br />
And poked through knot holes and pried through cracks;<br />
With wood from the pile and straw from the stacks<br />
He plugged the knot holes and calked the cracks;         <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
And a bucket of water, which one would think<br />
He had brought up into the loft to drink<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When he chanced to be dry,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Stood always nigh,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For Darius was sly!</span><span class="linenum">25</span><br />
And whenever at work he happened to spy<br />
At chink or crevice a blinking eye,<br />
He let a dipper of water fly.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span><br />
So day after day<br />
He stitched and tinkered and hammered away,              <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till at last 'twas done,&mdash;</span><br />
The greatest invention under the sun!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"An' now," says Darius, "hooray fer some fun!"</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Twas the Fourth of July,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the weather was dry,</span> <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
And not a cloud was on all the sky,<br />
Save a few light fleeces, which here and there,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Half mist, half air,</span><br />
Like foam on the ocean went floating by,&mdash;<br />
Just as lovely a morning as ever was seen                <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
For a nice little trip in a flying machine.<br />
<br />
Thought cunning Darius: "Now I shan't go<br />
Along 'ith the fellers to see the show:<br />
I'll say I've got sich a terrible cough!<br />
An' then, when the folks 'ave all gone off,              <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I'll have full swing</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fer to try the thing,</span><br />
An' practice a little on the wing."<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span><br />
"Ain't goin' to see the celebration?"<br />
Says brother Nate. "No; botheration!                     <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
I've got sich a cold&mdash;a toothache&mdash;I&mdash;<br />
My gracious!&mdash;feel's though I should fly!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Said Jotham, "'Sho!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Guess ye better go."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But Darius said, "No!</span><span class="linenum">25</span><br />
Shouldn't wonder 'f you might see me, though,<br />
'Long 'bout noon, if I get red<br />
O' this jumpin', thumpin' pain 'n my head."<br />
For all the while to himself he said:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I tell ye what!</span><br />
I'll fly a few times around the lot,<br />
To see how't seems, then soon's I've got<br />
The hang o' the thing, ez likely's not,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I'll astonish the nation,</span><span class="linenum">5</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">An' all creation,</span><br />
By flyin' over the celebration!<br />
Over their heads I'll sail like an eagle;<br />
I'll balance myself on my wings like a sea gull;<br />
I'll dance on the chimbleys; I'll stand on the steeple;  <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
I'll flop up to winders an' scare the people!<br />
I'll light on the liberty pole an' crow;<br />
An' I'll say to the gawpin' fools below,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'What world's this 'ere</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That I've come near?'</span><span class="linenum">15</span><br />
Fer I'll make 'em b'lieve I'm a chap f'm the moon;<br />
An' I'll try a race 'ith their ol' balloon!"<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He crept from his bed,</span><br />
And seeing the others were gone, he said:<br />
"I'm a gittin' over the cold 'n my head."                <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And away he sped,</span><br />
To open the wonderful box in the shed.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span><br />
His brothers had walked but a little way,<br />
When Jotham to Nathan chanced to say,<br />
"What is the feller up to, hey?"                         <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
"Don'o',&mdash;the' 's suthin' er other to pay,<br />
Er he wouldn't 'a' stayed to hum to-day."<br />
Says Burke, "His toothache's all 'n his eye!<br />
<i>He</i> never'd miss a Fo'th o' July,<br />
Ef he hedn't got some machine to try."                   <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
Then Sol, the little one, spoke: "By darn!<br />
Le's hurry back an' hide 'n the barn,<br />
An' pay him fer tellin' us that yarn!"<br />
<br />
"Agreed!" Through the orchard they creep back,<br />
Along by the fences, behind the stack,                    <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
And one by one, through a hole in the wall,<br />
In under the dusty barn they crawl,<br />
Dressed in their Sunday garments all.<br />
And a very astonishing sight was that,<br />
When each in his cobwebbed coat and hat                  <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
Came up through the floor like an ancient rat.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And there they hid;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Reuben slid</span><br />
The fastenings back, and the door undid.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Keep dark!" said he,</span><span class="linenum">15</span><br />
"While I squint an' see what the' is to see."<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span><br />
As knights of old put on their mail,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From head to foot</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">An iron suit,</span><br />
Iron jacket and iron boot,                               <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
Iron breeches, and on the head<br />
No hat, but an iron pot instead,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And under the chin the bail</span><br />
(I believe they called the thing a helm);<br />
And, thus accoutered, they took the field,               <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
Sallying forth to overwhelm<br />
The dragons and pagans that plagued the realm,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So this modern knight</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Prepared for flight,</span><br />
Put on his wings and strapped them tight,&mdash;<br />
Jointed and jaunty, strong and light,&mdash;<br />
Buckled them fast to shoulder and hip,&mdash;<br />
Ten feet they measured from tip to tip!<br />
And a helm had he, but that he wore,                      <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
Not on his head, like those of yore,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But more like the helm of a ship.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Hush!" Reuben said,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"He's up in the shed!</span><br />
He's opened the winder,&mdash;I see his head!                 <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He stretches it out,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">An' pokes it about,</span><br />
Lookin' to see 'f the coast is clear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">An' nobody near;&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Guess he don'o' who's hid in here!</span><span class="linenum">15</span><br />
He's riggin' a springboard over the sill!<br />
Stop laffin', Solomon! Burke, keep still!<br />
He's climbin' out now. Of all the things!<br />
What's he got on? I van, it's wings!<br />
An' that t'other thing? I vum, it's a tail!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">An' there he sets like a hawk on a rail!</span><span class="linenum">20</span><br />
Steppin' careful, he travels the length<br />
Of his springboard, and teeters to try its strength.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span><br />
"Now he stretches his wings like a monstrous bat;<br />
Peeks over his shoulder, this way an' that,              <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
Fer to see 'f the' 's anyone passin' by;<br />
But the' 's on'y a ca'f an' a goslin' nigh.<br />
<i>They</i> turn up at him a wonderin' eye,<br />
To see&mdash;the dragon! he's goin' to fly!<br />
Away he goes! Jiminy! what a jump!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Flop&mdash;flop&mdash;an' plump</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To the ground with a thump,</span><br />
Flutt'rin' an' flound'rin', all 'n a lump!"<br />
<br />
As a demon is hurled by an angel's spear,                 <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
Heels over head, to his proper sphere,<br />
Heels over head, and head over heels,<br />
Dizzily down the abyss he wheels,&mdash;<br />
So fell Darius. Upon his crown,<br />
In the midst of the barnyard, he came down,              <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
In a wonderful whirl of tangled strings,<br />
Broken braces and broken springs,<br />
Broken tail and broken wings,<br />
Shooting stars and various things,<br />
Barnyard litter of straw and chaff.                      <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
Away with a bellow fled the calf,<br />
And what was that? Did the gosling laugh?<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Tis a merry roar</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From the old barn door,</span><br />
And he hears the voice of Jotham crying,                 <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
"Say, D'rius! how do you like flyin'?"<br />
<br />
Slowly, ruefully, where he lay,<br />
Darius just turned and looked that way,<br />
As he stanched his sorrowful nose with his cuff.<br />
"Wall, I like flyin' well enough,"                       <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
He said, "but the' ain't sich a awful sight<br />
O' fun in't when ye come to light."<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;"><i>Moral</i></span><br />
<br />
I just have room for the moral here:<br />
And this is the moral,&mdash;Stick to your sphere.<br />
Or, if you insist, as you have the right,<br />
On spreading your wings for a loftier flight,<br />
The moral is,&mdash;Take care how you light.                   <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><br /><p>1. Tell the story of Icarus and D&aelig;dalus. Compare
Darius's flying machine with a modern airplane.
When and by whom was the airplane perfected as a
practical flyer?</p>

<p>2. How much of the story is told from Darius's
standpoint? Through whose eyes do we see the rest?</p>

<p>3. Describe Darius. Is he really a clever lad? Why
do we laugh at his experiment?</p>

<p>4. The poem is written partially in dialect.
Explain what "dialect" is. What other poems do you
know that are in dialect?</p>

<p>5. J. T. Trowbridge (1827-1916) was a clever
American writer of verse and fiction, chiefly boys'
books. Can you find anything of interest about him?</p></div>

<h2>AUNT DOLEFUL'S VISIT</h2>


<p>
How do you do, Cornelia? I heard you were sick, and<br />
I stepped in to cheer you up a little. My friends<br />
often say, "It's such a comfort to see you, Aunt Doleful.<br />
You have such a flow of conversation, and are <i>so</i> lively."<br />
Besides, I said to myself as I came up the stairs, "Perhaps           <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
it's the last time I'll ever see Cornelia Jane alive."<br />
</p><p>
<i>You don't mean to die yet, eh?</i> Well, now, how do you<br />
know? You can't tell. You think you are getting better;<br />
but there was poor Mrs. Jones sitting up, and everyone<br />
saying how smart she was, and all of a sudden she was taken          <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>with spasms in the heart and went off like a flash.<br />
</p><p>
But you must be careful and not get anxious or excited.<br />
Keep quite calm and don't fret about anything. Of course<br />
things can't go just as if you were downstairs; and I<br />
wondered whether you knew your little Billy was sailing<br />
about in a tub on the mill pond, and that your little Sammy           <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
was letting your little Jimmy down from the veranda<br />
roof in a clothes basket.<br />
</p><p>
Goodness! what's the matter? I guess Providence'll<br />
take care of them. Don't look so. You thought Bridget<br />
was watching them? Well, no, she isn't. I saw her talking<span class="linenum">10</span><br />
to a man at the gate. He looked to me like a burglar.<br />
No doubt she let him take the impression of the door key<br />
in wax, and then he'll get in and murder you all. There<br />
was a family at Murray Hill all killed last week.<br />
</p><p>
How is Mr. Kobble? Well, but finds it warm in town, eh?  <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
Well, I should think he would. They are dropping down by<br />
hundreds there with sunstroke. You must prepare your<br />
mind to have him brought home any day. Anyhow, a<br />
trip on these railroad trains is just risking your life every<br />
time you take one. Back and forth every day as he is,    <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
is just trifling with danger.<br />
</p><p>
Scarlet fever has broken out in the village, Cornelia.<br />
Little Isaac Potter has it, and I saw your Jimmy playing<br />

Well, I must be going now. I've got another sick         <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
friend, and I sha'n't consider my duty done unless I cheer<br />
her up a little before I sleep. You don't look so well as you did<br />
when I came in. But if anything happens, send for me at<br />
once. If I can't do anything else, I can cheer you up a little.<br />

<h2>GRADGRIND'S IDEA OF EDUCATION</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Charles Dickens</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Thomas Gradgrind was proud of himself. He was a
"self-made" man who attributed his own successes in
life to his mastery of Facts. He is here
represented as officially testing a school upon its
knowledge of his favorite Facts.</p></div>


<p>"Now what I want is Facts. Teach these boys and<br />
girls nothing but Facts. Facts alone are wanted<br />
in life. You can only form the minds of reasoning animals<br />
upon Facts; nothing else will ever be of any service to<br />
them. This is the principle on which I bring up my own                <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
children. Stick to Facts, sir; nothing but Facts."</p>

<p>The speaker, and the schoolmaster, and the third grown<br />
person present, all backed a little and swept with their eyes<br />
the inclined plane of little vessels then and there arranged<br />
in order, ready to have gallons of facts poured into them            <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
until they were full to the brim.</p>

<p>Thomas Gradgrind, sir. A man of realities. A man of<br />
facts and calculations. A man who proceeds upon the<br />
principle that two and two are four and nothing over,<br />
and who is not to be talked into allowing for anything over.         <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
Thomas Gradgrind, sir, with a rule and a pair of scales<br />
and the multiplication table always in his pocket, sir,<br />
ready to weigh and measure any parcel of human nature<br />
and tell you exactly what it comes to.</p>

<p>It is a mere question of figures, a case of simple arithmetic.       <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
You might hope to get some other nonsensical<br />
belief into the head of George Gradgrind, or Augustus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span><br />
Gradgrind, or John Gradgrind, or Joseph Gradgrind; but<br />
into the head of Thomas Gradgrind&mdash;no, sir!</p>

<p>Indeed, he seemed to be a kind of cannon loaded to the<br />
muzzle with facts.</p>

<p>"Girl number twenty," said Mr. Gradgrind, squarely                    <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
pointing with his square forefinger. "I don't know that<br />
girl. Who is that girl?"</p>

<p>"Sissy Jupe, sir," explained number twenty, blushing,<br />
standing up, and curtsying.</p>

<p>"Sissy is not a name," said Mr. Gradgrind. "Don't                    <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
call yourself Sissy. Call yourself Cecilia."</p>

<p>"Father calls me Sissy, sir," returned the young girl in a<br />
trembling voice and with another curtsy.</p>

<p>"Then he has no business to do it," said Mr. Gradgrind.<br />
"Tell him he mustn't. Cecilia Jupe. Let me see. What                 <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
is your father?"</p>

<p>"He belongs to the horse riding, if you please, sir."</p>

<p>Mr. Gradgrind frowned, and waved off the objectionable<br />
calling with his hand.</p>

<p>"We don't want to know anything about that, here.                    <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
You mustn't tell us about that, here. Your father breaks<br />
horses, don't he?"</p>

<p>"If you please, sir, when they can get any to break, they<br />
do break horses in the ring, sir."</p>

<p>"You mustn't tell us about the ring, here. Very well,                <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
then. Describe your father as a horse breaker. He<br />
doctors sick horses, I dare say."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir!"</p>

<p>"Very well, then. He is a veterinary surgeon, a farrier,<br />
and a horse breaker. Give me your definition of a horse."            <span class="linenum">30</span></p>

<p>Sissy Jupe was thrown into the greatest alarm by this<br />
demand.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>"Girl number twenty unable to define a horse!" said<br />
Mr. Gradgrind. "Girl number twenty possessed of no<br />
facts in reference to one of the commonest of animals!<br />
Some boy's definition of a horse. Bitzer, yours."</p>

<p>The square finger, moving here and there, lighted suddenly            <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
on Bitzer, perhaps because he chanced to sit in the<br />
same ray of sunlight which irradiated Sissy.</p>

<p>"Bitzer," said Thomas Gradgrind, "your definition of a<br />
horse."</p>

<p>"Quadruped. Graminivorous. Forty teeth: namely,                      <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
twenty-four grinders, four eyeteeth, and twelve incisors.<br />
Sheds coat in the spring; in marshy countries, sheds hoofs<br />
too. Hoofs hard, but requiring to be shod with iron.<br />
Age known by marks in the mouth."</p>

<p>"Now, girl number twenty," said Mr. Gradgrind, "you                  <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
know what a horse is."</p>

<p>She curtsied again and would have blushed deeper, if she<br />
could have blushed deeper than she had blushed all this<br />
time.</p>

<p>The third gentleman now stepped forth. A mighty man at               <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
cutting and drying, was he; a government officer; always<br />
in training, always with a system to force down the general<br />
throat, always to be heard of at the bar of his little public<br />
office.</p>

<p>"Very well," said this gentleman briskly, smiling and                <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
folding his arms. "That's a horse. Now, let me ask you,<br />
girls and boys, would you paper a room with representations<br />
of horses?"</p>

<p>After a pause, one half the children cried in a chorus,<br />
"Yes, sir!" Upon which the other half, seeing in the                 <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
gentleman's face that "yes" was wrong, cried out in a<br />
chorus, "No, sir!"&mdash;as the custom is in these examinations.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course not. Why wouldn't you?"</p>

<p>A pause. One corpulent slow boy, with a wheezy manner<br />
of breathing, ventured to answer, "Because I wouldn't<br />
paper a room at all; I'd paint it."</p>

<p>"You <i>must</i> paper it," said the gentleman rather warmly.         <span class="linenum">5</span></p>

<p>"Yes, you must paper it," said Thomas Gradgrind,<br />
"whether you like it or not. Don't tell <i>us</i> you wouldn't<br />
paper it. What do you mean, boy?"</p>

<p>"I'll explain to you, then," said the gentleman, after a<br />
dismal pause, "why you wouldn't paper a room with representations    <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
of horses. Do you ever see horses walking<br />
up and down the sides of a room in reality&mdash;in fact?<br />
Do you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir!" from one half. "No, sir!" from the other.</p>

<p>"Of course not," said the gentleman, with an indignant               <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
look at the wrong half. "Why, then, you are not to see<br />
anywhere what you don't see in fact; you are not to have<br />
anywhere what you don't have in fact. What is called<br />
taste is only another name for fact. This is a new principle,<br />
a discovery, a great discovery," said the gentleman. "Now            <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
I'll try you again. Suppose you were going to carpet a<br />
room, would you use a carpet having a representation of<br />
flowers upon it?"</p>

<p>There being a general conviction by this time that "No,<br />
sir!" was always the right answer to this gentleman, the             <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
chorus of "No," was very strong. Only a few feeble<br />
stragglers said, "Yes"; among them Sissy Jupe.</p>

<p>"Girl number twenty," said the gentleman, smiling in<br />
the calm strength of knowledge.</p>

<p>Sissy blushed and stood up.                                          <span class="linenum">30</span></p>

<p>"So you would carpet your room with representations of<br />
flowers, would you?" said the gentleman. "Why?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>"If you please, sir, I am very fond of flowers," returned<br />
the girl.</p>

<p>"And is that why you would put tables and chairs upon<br />
them and have people walking over them with heavy<br />
boots?"                                                               <span class="linenum">5</span></p>

<p>"It wouldn't hurt them, sir. They wouldn't crush and,<br />
wither, if you please, sir. They would be the pictures of<br />
what was very pretty and pleasant, and I fancy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, aye! But you mustn't fancy," cried the<br />
gentleman, quite elated by coming so happily to his point.           <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
"That's it! You are never to fancy."</p>

<p>"You are not, Cecilia Jupe," Thomas Gradgrind solemnly<br />
repeated, "to do anything of that kind."</p>

<p>"You are to be in all things regulated and governed,"<br />
said the gentleman, "by Fact. You must discard the word              <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
'fancy' altogether. You have nothing to do with it.<br />
You don't walk upon flowers in fact; you cannot be allowed<br />
to walk upon flowers in carpets. You never meet with<br />
quadrupeds going up and down the walls; you must not<br />
have quadrupeds represented upon the walls. You must                 <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
use," said the gentleman, "for all these purposes, combinations<br />
and modifications (in primary colors) of mathematical<br />
figures which are susceptible of proof and demonstration.<br />
This is the new discovery. This is Fact. This<br />
is taste."                                                           <span class="linenum">25</span></p>

<h2>THE DEACON'S MASTERPIECE,<br />
OR THE WONDERFUL "ONE-HOSS SHAY"</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Oliver Wendell Holmes</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes (1809-1894) was born at
Cambridge, Mass. Although he practiced his
profession of medicine, was Professor of Anatomy
and Physiology at the Harvard Medical School, and
wrote some scientific works, he is best known as
the author of poems and essays, mostly humorous,
light, and fanciful. He was very popular in his
time as a witty conversationalist and a brilliant
speech maker.</p></div>


<div>
Have you heard of the wonderful one-hoss shay,<br />
That was built in such a logical way?<br />
It ran a hundred years to a day,<br />
And then, of a sudden, it&mdash;ah, but stay,<br />
I'll tell you what happened without delay&mdash;               <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
Scaring the parson into fits,<br />
Frightening people out of their wits&mdash;<br />
Have you ever heard of that, I say?<br />
<br />
Seventeen hundred and fifty-five.<br />
<i>Georgius Secundus</i> was then alive&mdash;                <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
Snuffy old drone from the German hive.<br />
That was the year when Lisbon town<br />
Saw the earth open and gulp her down,<br />
And Braddock's army was done so brown,<br />
Left without a scalp to its crown.                       <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
It was on the terrible Earthquake day<br />
That the Deacon finished the one-hoss shay.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span><br />
Now in building of chaises I tell you what,<br />
There is always <i>somewhere</i> a weakest spot&mdash;<br />
In hub, tire, felloe, in spring or thill,<br />
In panel or crossbar or floor or sill,<br />
In screw, bolt, thorough-brace,&mdash;lurking still,           <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
Find it somewhere you must and will&mdash;<br />
Above or below or within or without&mdash;<br />
And that's the reason, beyond a doubt,<br />
A chaise <i>breaks down</i>, but doesn't <i>wear out</i>.<br />
<br />
But the Deacon swore (as Deacons do,                     <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
With an "I dew vum" or an "I tell <i>yeou</i>")<br />
He would build one shay to beat the taown<br />
'N' the keounty 'n' all the kentry raoun';<br />
It should be so built that it <i>couldn't</i> break daown.<br />
<br />
"Fur," said the Deacon, "'t's mighty plain               <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
Thut the weakes' place mus' stan' the strain;<br />
'N' the way t' fix it, uz I maintain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is only jest</span><br />
T' make that place uz strong uz the rest."<br />
<br />
So the Deacon inquired of the village folk               <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
Where he could find the strongest oak,<br />
That couldn't be split nor bent nor broke&mdash;<br />
That was for spokes and floor and sills;<br />
He sent for lancewood to make the thills;<br />
The crossbars were ash, from the straightest trees       <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
The panels of whitewood, that cuts like cheese<br />
But lasts like iron for things like these;<br />
The hubs, of logs from the "Settler's ellum"&mdash;<br />
Last of its timber&mdash;they couldn't sell 'em&mdash;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span><br />
Never an ax had seen their chips,<br />
And the wedges flew from between their lips,<br />
Their blunt ends frizzled like celery tips;<br />
Step and prop iron, bolt and screw,<br />
Spring, tire, axle, and linchpin too,                     <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
Steel of the finest, bright and blue;<br />
Thorough-brace, bison skin, thick and wide;<br />
Boot, top, dasher, from tough old hide<br />
Found in the pit when the tanner died.<br />
That was the way he "put her through."                   <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
"There!" said the Deacon, "naow she'll dew!"<br />
<br />
Do! I tell you, I rather guess<br />
She was a wonder, and nothing less!<br />
Colts grew horses, beards turned gray,<br />
Deacon and deaconess dropped away,                       <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
Children and grandchildren&mdash;where were they?<br />
But there stood the stout old one-hoss shay,<br />
As fresh as on Lisbon-Earthquake day!<br />
<br />
<i>Eighteen hundred</i>&mdash;it came and found<br />
The Deacon's masterpiece strong and sound.               <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
Eighteen hundred increased by ten&mdash;<br />
"Hahnsum kerridge" they called it then.<br />
Eighteen hundred and twenty came&mdash;<br />
Running as usual; much the same.<br />
Thirty and Forty at last arrive,                         <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
And then come Fifty&mdash;and <i>Fifty-five</i>.<br />
<br />
Little of all we value here<br />
Wakes on the morn of its hundredth year<br />
Without both feeling and looking queer.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span><br />
In fact there's nothing that keeps its youth,<br />
So far as I know, but a tree and truth.<br />
(This is a moral that runs at large;<br />
Take it.&mdash;You're welcome.&mdash;No extra charge.)<br />
<br />
<i>First of November</i>&mdash;the Earthquake day&mdash;            <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
There are traces of age in the one-hoss shay,<br />
A general flavor of mild decay,<br />
But nothing local, as one may say.<br />
There couldn't be&mdash;for the Deacon's art<br />
Had made it so like in every part                        <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
That there wasn't a chance for one to start.<br />
<br />
For the wheels were just as strong as the thills,<br />
And the floor was just as strong as the sills,<br />
And the panels just as strong as the floor,<br />
And the whippletree neither less nor more,               <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
And the back crossbar as strong as the fore,<br />
And spring, and axle, and hub <i>encore</i>.<br />
And yet, <i>as a whole</i>, it is past a doubt<br />
In another hour it will be <i>worn out!</i><br />
<br />
First of November, Fifty-five!                           <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
This morning the parson takes a drive.<br />
Now, small boys, get out of the way!<br />
Here comes the wonderful one-hoss shay,<br />
Drawn by a rat-tailed, ewe-necked bay.<br />
"Huddup!" said the parson.&mdash;Off went they.               <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
<br />
The parson was working his Sunday's text&mdash;<br />
Had got to <i>fifthly</i>, and stopped perplexed<br />
At what the&mdash;Moses&mdash;was coming next.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span><br />
All at once the horse stood still,<br />
Close by the meet'n'house on the hill.<br />
First a shiver, and then a thrill,<br />
Then something decidedly like a spill&mdash;<br />
And the parson was sitting upon a rock,                   <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
At half past nine by the meet'n'house clock&mdash;<br />
Just the hour of the Earthquake shock!<br />
<br />
What do you think the parson found<br />
When he got up and stared around?<br />
The poor old chaise in a heap, or mound,                 <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
As if it had been to the mill and ground!<br />
You see, of course, if you're not a dunce,<br />
How it went to pieces all at once&mdash;<br />
All at once, and nothing first&mdash;<br />
Just as bubbles do when they burst.                      <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
<br />
End of the wonderful one-hoss shay.<br />
Logic is logic. That's all I say.<br />

<div class="blockquot"><br /><p>1. What kind of vehicle did the Deacon build? What
was his theory as to building a "shay"?</p>

<p>2. How did he carry out his theory? Read the

<h2>THE SCHOOLMASTER'S RIDE</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Washington Irving</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The time of this story is post-Revolutionary.
Ichabod Crane, a lean, awkward schoolmaster, has
been courting the village belle, Katrina Van
Tassel, his rival being Brom Bones, a powerful
fellow, noted for his pugnacity. He has frequently
threatened Ichabod for aspiring to the charming
Katrina. Here, Ichabod, at a late hour, is leaving
the Van Tassel home after a "quilting frolic" where
he took occasion to propose to Katrina. Judge of
the young lady's answer!</p></div>


<p>
Ichabod, heavy-hearted and crestfallen, pursued his<br />
travel homewards, along the sides of the lofty hills<br />
which rise above Tarrytown. The hour was as dismal as<br />
himself. Far below him the Tappan Zee spread its dusky<br />
and indistinct waste of waters, with here and there the   <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
tall mast of a sloop riding quietly at anchor under the<br />
land. In the dead hush of midnight he could even hear<br />
the barking of the watchdog from the opposite shore of the<br />
Hudson; but it was so vague and faint as only to give an<br />
idea of his great distance from this faithful companion of           <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
man. Now and then, too, the long-drawn crowing of a<br />
cock, accidentally awakened, would sound far, far off,<br />
from some farmhouse away among the hills. No signs of<br />
life occurred near him, but occasionally the melancholy<br />
chirp of a cricket, or perhaps the guttural twang of a bullfrog      <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
from a neighboring marsh, as if sleeping uncomfortably<br />
and turning suddenly in his bed.<br />
</p><p>
The night grew darker and darker, the stars seemed to<br />
sink deeper in the sky, and driving clouds occasionally hid<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>them from his sight. He had never felt so lonely and     <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
dismal. In the center of the road stood an enormous tulip<br />
tree, which towered like a giant above all the other trees<br />
of the neighborhood and formed a kind of landmark. It<br />
was connected with the tragical story of the unfortunate<br />
Andr&eacute;, who had been taken prisoner hard by, and was       <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
universally known by the name of Major Andr&eacute;'s Tree.<br />
The common people regarded it with a mixture of respect<br />
and superstition.<br />
</p><p>
As Ichabod approached this fearful tree, he began to<br />
whistle. He thought his whistle was answered. It was     <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
but a blast sweeping through the dry branches. As he<br />
approached a little nearer, he thought he saw something<br />
white hanging in the midst of the tree. He paused and<br />
ceased whistling; but on looking more narrowly, perceived<br />
that it was a place where the tree had been scathed by   <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
lightning and the white wood laid bare. Suddenly he heard<br />
a groan. His teeth chattered, and his knees smote against<br />
the saddle. It was but the rubbing of one huge bough upon<br />
another as they were swayed about by the breeze. He<br />
passed the tree in safety, but new perils lay before him.<span class="linenum">20</span><br />
</p><p>
About two hundred yards from the tree a small brook<br />
crossed the road and ran into a marshy and thickly wooded<br />
glen, known by the name of Wiley's Swamp. A few rough<br />
logs, laid side by side, served for a bridge over this stream.<br />
To pass this bridge was the severest trial. It was at this           <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
identical spot that the unfortunate Andr&eacute; was captured,<br />
and this has ever since been considered a haunted stream,<br />
and fearful are the feelings of the schoolboy who has to<br />
pass it alone after dark.<br />
</p><p>
As he approached the stream his heart began to thump.    <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
He summoned up, however, all his resolution, gave his<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>horse half a score of kicks in the ribs, and attempted to<br />
dash briskly across the bridge. But instead of starting<br />
forward, the perverse old animal made a lateral movement<br />
and ran broadside against the fence. Ichabod, whose fears<br />
increased with the delay, jerked the reins on the other side<br />
and kicked lustily with the contrary foot. It was all in  <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
vain. His steed started, it is true, but it was only to<br />
plunge to the opposite side of the road into a thicket of<br />
brambles and alder bushes.<br />
</p><p>
The schoolmaster now bestowed both whip and heel<br />
upon the starveling ribs of old Gunpowder, who dashed    <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
forward, snuffling and snorting, but came to a stand just<br />
by the bridge with a suddenness which had nearly sent his<br />
rider sprawling over his head. Just at this moment a<br />
plashy tramp on the bank of the stream, by the side of<br />
the bridge, caught the sensitive ear of Ichabod. In the  <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
dark shadow of the grove, on the margin of the murmuring<br />
brook, he beheld something huge, misshapen, black, and<br />
towering. It stirred not, but seemed gathering up in the<br />
gloom, like some gigantic monster ready to spring upon the<br />
traveler.                                                <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
</p><p>
The hair of the affrighted pedagogue rose upon his head<br />
with terror. What was to be done? To turn and fly was now<br />
too late. Summoning up, therefore, a show of courage, he<br />
demanded, in stammering tones, "<i>Who are you?</i>" He<br />
received no reply.                                       <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
</p><p>
He repeated his demand in a still more agitated voice.<br />
Still there was no answer. Once more he cudgeled the sides<br />
of the inflexible Gunpowder, and shutting his eyes, broke<br />
forth with involuntary fervor into a psalm tune. Just then<br />
the shadowy object of alarm put itself in motion, and with a         <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
scramble and a bound, stood at once in the middle of the road.<br />
</p><p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>Though the night was dark and dismal, yet the form of<br />
the unknown might now, in some degree, be ascertained.<br />
He appeared to be a horseman of large dimensions and<br />
mounted on a black horse of powerful frame. He made<br />
no offer of molestation or sociability, but kept aloof on<br />
one side of the road. Ichabod, who had no relish for this <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
strange midnight companion, now quickened his steed in<br />
hopes of leaving him behind. The stranger quickened<br />
his horse to an equal pace. Ichabod pulled up and fell<br />
into a walk, thinking to lag behind. The other did the<br />
same. His heart began to sink within him. He endeavored  <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
to resume his psalm tune, but his parched tongue clove to<br />
the roof of his mouth, and he could not utter a stave.<br />
</p><p>
There was something in the moody and dogged silence<br />
of this pertinacious companion that was mysterious and<br />
appalling. It was soon fearfully accounted for. On       <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
mounting a rising ground, which brought the figure of his<br />
fellow traveler in relief against the sky, gigantic in height<br />
and muffled in a cloak, Ichabod was horror-struck on perceiving<br />
that he was headless! But his horror was still more<br />
increased on observing that the head which should have   <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
rested on his shoulders was carried before him on the<br />
pommel of his saddle! His terror rose to desperation.<br />
He rained a shower of kicks and blows upon Gunpowder,<br />
hoping by a sudden movement to give his companion the<br />
slip. But the specter started full jump with him. Away   <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
then they dashed, through thick and thin, stones flying<br />
and sparks flashing at every bound.<br />
</p><p>
An opening in the trees now cheered him with the hopes<br />
that the church bridge was at hand. The wavering reflection<br />
of a silver star in the bosom of the brook told him that <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
he was not mistaken. "If I can but reach that bridge,"<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>thought Ichabod, "I am safe." Just then he heard the<br />
black steed panting and blowing close behind him; he<br />
even fancied that he felt his hot breath. Another convulsive<br />
kick in the ribs, and old Gunpowder sprang<br />
upon the bridge; he thundered over the resounding<br />
planks; he gained the opposite side; and now Ichabod      <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
cast a look behind to see if his pursuer should vanish,<br />
according to rule, in a flash of fire and brimstone. Just<br />
then he saw the goblin rising in his stirrups, and in the very<br />
act of hurling his head at him. Ichabod endeavored to<br />
dodge the horrible missile, but too late. It encountered <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
his cranium with a tremendous crash. He was tumbled<br />
headlong into the dust, and Gunpowder, the black steed,<br />
and the goblin rider passed by like a whirlwind.<br />
</p><p>
The next morning the old horse was found without his<br />
saddle, and with the bridle under his feet, soberly cropping         <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
the grass at his master's gate, while near the bridge, on<br />
the bank of a broad part of the brook where the water<br />
ran deep and black, was found the hat of the unfortunate<br />
Ichabod, and close beside it&mdash;<i>a shattered pumpkin!</i><br />

<h2>SIGNING PETITIONS</h2>


<p>
"Another petition!" exclaimed the banker. "No, I<br />
never sign them offhand&mdash;not any more. I used to<br />
do so&mdash;once to my sorrow and to the amusement of my<br />
friends. Leave yours with me till day after to-morrow and<br />
I'll consider it. I have at least four more now on the waiting        <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
list, ranging in subject from the Removal of a Soap Factory<br />
to a Bridge Across the Pacific. Every business man is<br />
hounded week in and week out with petitions."<br />
</p><p>
I reluctantly surrendered my long scroll with its formidable<br />
list of signatures. "But <i>the</i> one that you once signed&mdash;what   <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
of that?"<br />
</p><p>
"Oh, that one? Well, there was a bright newsboy down<br />
on the square whose booth had been removed from a street<br />
corner because of a petition to the Police Commissioner.<br />
Of course everybody had signed the petition; for signing <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
petitions was considered the proper thing if certain names<br />
headed the list. It came to be a roster of the best families<br />
in town. This newsboy retaliated&mdash;in kind. He drafted<br />
and circulated a petition that was in due form. Everybody,<br />
including myself, signed it. Next day it was published in<span class="linenum">20</span><br />
full with the names of its signers, by all our city papers, and<br />
by night everybody in the state was laughing at us.<br />
</p><p>
"The petition recited that a sundial in Central Park, the<br />
gift of a wealthy citizen, was weathering badly. It should<br />
be protected. That sounded reasonable, so everybody      <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
signed just below the name of everybody else. And what<br />
had we petitioned for? <i>A roof to cover that sundial!</i><br />
</p><p>
"You'll get no hasty signatures to a petition in this<br />
city&mdash;we remember the sundial!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span><br />

<h2>GREAT LITTLE RIVERS</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Frazier Hunt</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The armies of the world were contending on the
battlefields of France in a death struggle, known
in history as the World War. It was a mighty clash
of ideas and ideals. Frazier Hunt, a war
correspondent and journalist, selected the Little
Rivers of France as a subject to carry his theme:
that little things sometimes set apart great
differences, and that littleness and greatness are
not matters of physical size.</p></div>


<p>
For miles along the hard white road that had helped<br />
save France a tiny river ran. But it was such a quiet<br />
race with life and time. It had no steep banks; only gentle,<br />
green, silent slopes that fell gracefully back from its edges.<br />
Here and there fragrant woods wandered almost to its      <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
drowsy waters.<br />
</p><p>
A cuckoo sounded its call, and far off its mate sent<br />
back the echo. On sun-splashed mornings the thrush<br />
came, and in the moonlight the nightingale sang to<br />
this little stream.                                      <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
</p><p>
It was a tiny river, and if in great America, only the<br />
countryside that knew its winding ways could have told<br />
its name. It was a brook for poets to dream by. Little<br />
islands of willows, weeping for France, slept in its heart.<br />
One could almost whisper across it, and as a French schoolgirl       <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
of fourteen wrote, "Birds could fly over it with one<br />
sweep of their wings. And on the two banks there were<br />
millions of men, the one turned towards the other, eye to<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>eye. But the distance which separated them was greater<br />
than the stars in the sky; it was the distance which separates<br />
right from injustice."<br />
</p><p>
It was a tiny river; it was the Yser.<br />
</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>
Oxen drawing the cultivating plows that will help feed<br />
France and win the war almost splash into its shallow edges           <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
as they turn the furrow. And on hot July days, the old<br />
man who prods them with his pointed stick and the sturdy<br />
woman who handles the plow let them drink their fill of<br />
its cooling waters&mdash;not plunging their noses deep like<br />
thirsty horses but gently drawing in the water with the lips,        <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
after the manner of oxen.<br />
</p><p>
It is a quiet stream that a child could ford without danger.<br />
It flows slowly and sweetly from the mother hills to the<br />
embracing sea. A few arched bridges leap from one low<br />
bank to another. It has not cut deep into the land of    <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
France but it has cut deep into the heart of France. It is<br />
one of the ribbons of victory and glory that France will<br />
always wear across her breast. And it is a ribbon made red<br />
by the blood of the men of France who have died for France.<br />
</p><p>
And yet we of America would call it a little stream, and <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
old men would fish all day in it from a shaded velvet point,<br />
and boys swimming would hunt some favorite Devil's Hole<br />
where they might dive.<br />
</p><p>
It is the Marne.<br />
</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>
For four years now it has flowed peacefully on while     <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
men have fought to scar its banks with trenches&mdash;burrowing<br />
themselves into the earth as only the muskrat had done<br />
in the forgotten days of peace. Strong, unafraid men came<br />
from the ends of the world to die by its side. And it would<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>have gladly sung them a sweet, low lullaby, crooning a song          <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
with which mothers on the shores of all the seven seas had<br />
once rocked them to sleep&mdash;only now the sound of heavy<br />
firing, dull booms of the cannon, and the spit and nervous<br />
drum of the machine gun, made its song as futile and indistinguishable<br />
as the whisper of a child in the roar of a mob.           <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
</p><p>
What a story its sweet waters had to tell to all the rivers<br />
of the world when they met in the broad sea: a tale of<br />
strange men who fought and died that it might still be a<br />
part of France; a tale of deeds of glory and of valor and<br />
of sacrifice. And some of these men had come from faraway<span class="linenum">10</span><br />
America to this little river, this stream so tiny and so<br />
modest that it might have forever remained unknown and<br />
unsung.<br />
</p><p>
It was the Somme.<br />
</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>
After all, what does size matter&mdash;except the size of the <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
heart and of the soul?<br />
</p><p>
The great Mississippi, the mystic Amazon, the majestic<br />
Hudson, the wide Danube&mdash;all mighty in power and commerce!<br />
</p><p>
The Yser, the Aisne, the Oise, the Somme, the Marne&mdash;little          <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
streams of France; old brooks as precious as Thermopyl&aelig;<br />
or Bunker Hill!<br />

<h2>THE BURIAL OF SIR JOHN MOORE</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Charles Wolfe</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Sir John Moore (1761-1809) was a British general.
His last engagement was at the head of the British
forces in Spain, fighting against Napoleon. Upon
word that Napoleon with an army of 70,000 was
marching against him, he decided to make for the
coast with his 25,000 men. They were obliged to
march for 250 miles over slippery mountain roads,
and were forced into battle before they could
embark. The French were repulsed with heavy losses,
but Moore was fatally wounded. This fine poem
describes his burial on that foreign shore.</p></div>


<div>
Not a drum was heard, not a funeral note,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As his corse to the ramparts we hurried;</span><br />
Not a soldier discharged his farewell shot<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O'er the grave where our hero we buried.</span><br />
<br />
We buried him darkly at dead of night,                    <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sods with our bayonets turning,</span><br />
By the struggling moonbeam's misty light,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the lantern dimly burning.</span><br />
<br />
No useless coffin inclosed his breast,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Not in sheet or in shroud we wound him;</span><span class="linenum">10</span><br />
But he lay like a warrior taking his rest<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With his martial cloak around him.</span><br />
<br />
Few and short were the prayers we said,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And we spoke not a word of sorrow;</span><br />
But we steadfastly gazed on the face of the dead,        <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And we bitterly thought of the morrow.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span><br />
We thought, as we hollowed his narrow bed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And smoothed down his lonely pillow,</span><br />
That the foe and the stranger would tread o'er his head.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And we far away on the billow.</span><br />
<br />
Lightly they'll talk of the spirit that's gone,           <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And o'er his cold ashes upbraid him;</span><br />
But little he'll reck, if they let him sleep on,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the grave where a Briton has laid him.</span><br />
<br />
But half of our heavy task was done<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When the bell tolled the hour for retiring;</span><span class="linenum">10</span><br />
And we heard the distant and random gun<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That the foe was sullenly firing.</span><br />
<br />
Slowly and sadly we laid him down,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From the field of his fame fresh and gory;</span><br />
We carved not a line, and we raised not a stone,         <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But we left him alone with his glory!</span><br />

<h2>LEXINGTON AND CONCORD</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By William Emerson</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Reverend William Emerson, grandfather of Ralph
Waldo Emerson, was pastor of the Congregational
Church at Concord. The battle of April 19, 1775,
was fought near his residence. He was called the
"patriot preacher" and died while serving in the
Revolutionary army.</p></div>


<p>
This morning between one and two o'clock we were<br />
alarmed by the ringing of the church bell, and upon<br />
examination found that the troops, to the number of eight<br />
hundred, had stolen their march from Boston in boats and<br />
barges from the bottom of the Common over to a point      <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
in Cambridge near to Inman's farm, and were at Lexington<br />
meetinghouse half an hour before sunrise, where they had<br />
fired upon a body of our men, and as we afterward heard,<br />
had killed several. This intelligence was brought to us at<br />
first by Dr. Samuel Prescott, who narrowly escaped the   <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
guard that were sent before on horses purposely to prevent<br />
all posts and messengers from giving us timely information.<br />
He, by the help of a very fleet horse, crossing several walls<br />
and fences, arrived at Concord at the time above mentioned,<br />
when several posts were immediately dispatched,          <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
that, returning, confirmed the presence of the regular<br />
army at Lexington, and that they were on their way to<br />
Concord. Upon this a number of our minutemen belonging<br />
to this town and Acton and Lincoln, with several others<br />
that were in readiness, marched out to meet them.        <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
</p><p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>While the alarm company were preparing to meet them<br />
in the town, Captain Minot, who commanded them,<br />
thought it proper to take possession of the hill above the<br />
meetinghouse as the most advantageous situation. No<br />
sooner had we gained it than we were met by the company<br />
that were sent out to meet the troops, who informed us    <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
they were just upon us and that we must retreat, as their<br />
number was more than thribble to ours. We then retreated<br />
from the hill near Liberty Pole and took a new post<br />
back of the town upon a rising eminence, where we formed<br />
into two battalions and waited the arrival of the enemy. <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
Scarcely had we formed before we saw the British troops<br />
at the distance of a quarter of a mile, glittering in arms,<br />
advancing toward us with the greatest celerity.<br />
</p><p>
Some were for making a stand notwithstanding the<br />
superiority of their numbers, but others more prudent    <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
thought best to retreat till our strength should be equal<br />
to the enemy by recruits from neighboring towns who were<br />
continually coming in to our assistance. Accordingly we<br />
retreated over the bridge; when the troops came into the<br />
town, set fire to several carriages for the artillery, destroyed     <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
sixty barrels of flour, rifled several houses, took possession<br />
of the Town House, destroyed five hundred pounds of<br />
ball, set a guard of a hundred men at the North Bridge,<br />
and sent up a party to the house of Colonel Barrett, where<br />
they were in expectation of finding a quantity of warlike<span class="linenum">25</span><br />
stores; but these were happily secured just before their<br />
arrival by transfer into the woods and other by-places.<br />
In the meantime, the guard set by the enemy to secure the<br />
pass at the North Bridge were alarmed by the approach<br />
of our people, who had retreated, as mentioned before,   <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
and were now advancing with special orders not to fire<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>upon the troops unless fired upon.<br />
</p><p>
These orders were so punctually observed that we received<br />
the fire of the enemy in three several and separate<br />
discharges of their pieces before it was returned by our<br />
commanding officer. The firing then soon became general<br />
for several minutes, in which skirmish two were killed on <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
each side and several of the enemy wounded. It may here<br />
be observed, by the way, that we were the more careful<br />
to prevent beginning a rupture with the King's troops as<br />
we were then uncertain what had happened at Lexington<br />
and knew not that they had begun the quarrel there by    <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
first firing upon our party and killing eight men upon the<br />
spot. The British troops soon quitted their post at the<br />
bridge and retreated in great disorder and confusion to the<br />
main body, who were soon upon the march to meet them.<br />
For half an hour the enemy, by their marches and countermarches,     <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
discovered great fickleness and inconstancy of<br />
mind, sometimes advancing, sometimes returning to their<br />

by the way they came. In the meantime a party of<br />
our men (one hundred and fifty) took the back way through<span class="linenum">20</span><br />
the great fields into the East Quarter and had placed themselves<br />
to advantage, lying in ambush behind walls, fences,<br />
and buildings, ready to fire upon the enemy on their retreat.<br />

<h2>HERV&Eacute; RIEL</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Robert Browning</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Robert Browning (1812-1889) is one of the great
poets of England. The following incident of a
simple French sailor performing a deed of heroism
appealed to Browning's dramatic sense; hence this
stirring ballad. The poem was written in 1871, when
France was suffering defeat in the Franco-Prussian
War. The proceeds from its sale (one hundred
pounds) were contributed to French war sufferers.</p></div>


<div>
On the sea and at the Hogue, sixteen hundred<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">ninety-two,</span><br />
Did the English fight the French,&mdash;woe to France!<br />
And, the thirty-first of May, helter-skelter through the blue,<br />
Like a crowd of frightened porpoises a shoal of sharks    <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">pursue,</span><br />
Came crowding ship on ship to Saint Malo on the Rance,<br />
With the English fleet in view.<br />
<br />
'Twas the squadron that escaped, with the victor in full<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">chase;</span><span class="linenum">10</span><br />
First and foremost of the drove, in his great ship,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Damfreville;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Close on him fled, great and small,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Twenty-two good ships in all;</span><br />
And they signaled to the place&mdash;                         <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
"Help the winners of a race!<br />
Get us guidance, give us harbor, take us quick&mdash;or, quicker<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">still,</span><br />
Here's the English can and will!"<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span><br />
Then the pilots of the place put out brisk and leapt on<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">board.</span><br />
"Why, what hope or chance have ships like these to pass?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">laughed they.</span><br />
"Rocks to starboard, rocks to port, all the passage scarred            <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">and scored,</span><br />
Shall the <i>Formidable</i> here, with her twelve and eighty guns,<br />
Think to make the river mouth by the single narrow way,<br />
Trust to enter where 'tis ticklish for a craft of twenty tons,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And with flow at full beside?</span><span class="linenum">10</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now, 'tis slackest ebb of tide.</span><br />
Reach the mooring? Rather say,<br />
While rock stands or water runs,<br />
Not a ship will leave the bay!"<br />
<br />
Then was called a council straight.                      <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
Brief and bitter the debate:<br />
"Here's the English at our heels; would you have them<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">take in tow</span><br />
All that's left us of the fleet, linked together stern and bow,<br />
For a prize to Plymouth Sound?                           <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
Better run the ships aground!"&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(Ended Damfreville his speech)&mdash;</span><br />
"Not a minute more to wait!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Let the captains all and each</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shove ashore, then blow up, burn the vessels on the</span><span class="linenum">25</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">beach!</span><br />
France must undergo her fate.<br />
<br />
"Give the word!" But no such word<br />
Was ever spoke or heard;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>For up stood, for out stepped, for in struck, amid all these&mdash;        <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
A captain? A lieutenant? A mate&mdash;first, second, third?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No such man of mark, and meet</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With his betters to compete,</span><br />
But a simple Breton sailor pressed by Tourville for the<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">fleet&mdash;<span class="linenum">5</span></span><br />
A poor coasting pilot he, Herv&eacute; Riel the Croisickese.<br />
And "What mockery or malice have we here?" cries Herv&eacute;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Riel.</span><br />
"Are you mad, you Malouins? Are you cowards, fools, or<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">rogues?</span><span class="linenum">10</span><br />
Talk to me of rocks and shoals, me who took the soundings,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">tell</span><br />
On my fingers every bank, every shallow, every swell,<br />
'Twixt the offing here and Gr&egrave;ve where the river<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">disembogues?</span><span class="linenum">15</span><br />
Are you bought by English gold? Is it love the lying's<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">for?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Morn and eve, night and day,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Have I piloted your bay,</span><br />
Entered free and anchored fast at the foot of Solidor.   <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
Burn the fleet and ruin France? That were worse than<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">fifty Hogues!</span><br />
Sirs, they know I speak the truth! Sirs, believe me there's<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">a way!</span><br />
Only let me lead the line,                               <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Have the biggest ship to steer;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Get this <i>Formidable</i> clear,</span><br />
Make the others follow mine,<br />
And I lead them, most and least, by a passage I know well,<br />
Right to Solidor past Gr&egrave;ve,                             <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And there lay them safe and sound;</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">And if one ship misbehave&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Keel so much as grate the ground&mdash;</span><br />
Why, I've nothing but my life&mdash;here's my head!" cries<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Herv&eacute; Riel.</span><br />
<br />
Not a minute more to wait.<br />
"Steer us in, then, small and great!                      <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
Take the helm, lead the line, save the squadron!" cried its<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">chief.</span><br />
"Captains, give the sailor place!<br />
He is admiral, in brief."<br />
Still the north wind, by God's grace!                    <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
See the noble fellow's face<br />
As the big ship, with a bound,<br />
Clears the entry like a hound,<br />
Keeps the passage as its inch of way were the wide seas<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">profound!</span><span class="linenum">15</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">See, safe through shoal and rock,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How they follow in a flock,</span><br />
Not a ship that misbehaves, not a keel that grates the<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">ground,</span><br />
Not a spar that comes to grief!                          <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The peril, see, is past,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All are harbored to the last,</span><br />
And just as Herv&eacute; Riel hollas "Anchor!"&mdash;sure as fate,<br />
Up the English come&mdash;too late!<br />
<br />
So the storm subsides to calm;                           <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They see the green trees wave</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On the heights o'erlooking Gr&egrave;ve;</span><br />
Hearts that bled are stanched with balm.<br />
"Just our rapture to enhance,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>Let the English rake the bay,                            <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
Gnash their teeth and glare askance<br />
As they cannonade away!<br />
'Neath rampired Solidor pleasant riding on the Rance!"<br />
How hope succeeds despair on each captain's countenance!<br />
<br />
Out burst all with one accord,                            <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"This is paradise for hell!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Let France, let France's king,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thank the man that did the thing!"</span><br />
What a shout, and all one word,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Herv&eacute; Riel!"</span><span class="linenum">10</span><br />
As he stepped in front once more,<br />
Not a symptom of surprise<br />
In the frank blue Breton eyes,<br />
Just the same man as before.<br />
<br />
Then said Damfreville, "My friend,                       <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
I must speak out at the end,<br />
Though I find the speaking hard.<br />
Praise is deeper than the lips;<br />
You have saved the King his ships,<br />
You must name your own reward.                           <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
Faith, our sun was near eclipse!<br />
Demand whate'er you will,<br />
France remains your debtor still.<br />
Ask to heart's content and have!&mdash;or my name's not<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Damfreville."</span><span class="linenum">25</span><br />
<br />
Then a beam of fun outbroke<br />
On the bearded mouth that spoke,<br />
As the honest heart laughed through<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>Those frank eyes of Breton blue:<br />
"Since I needs must say my say,<br />
Since on board the duty's done&mdash;<br />
And from Malo Roads to Croisic Point, what is it but a<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">run?&mdash;</span><br />
Since 'tis ask and have, I may&mdash;                          <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
Since the others go ashore&mdash;?<br />
Come! A good whole holiday!<br />
Leave to go and see my wife, whom I call the Belle Aurore!"<br />
That he asked and that he got,&mdash;nothing more.<br />
<br />
Name and deed alike are lost:                            <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
Not a pillar nor a post<br />
In his Croisic keeps alive the feat as it befell;<br />
Not a head in white and black<br />
On a single fishing smack,<br />
In memory of the man but for whom had gone to wrack      <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
All that France saved from the fight whence England bore<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">the bell.</span><br />
Go to Paris: rank on rank<br />
Search the heroes flung pell-mell<br />
On the Louvre, face and flank!                           <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
You shall look long enough ere you come to Herv&eacute; Kiel.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So, for better and for worse,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Herv&eacute; Riel, accept my verse!</span><br />
In my verse, Herv&eacute; Riel, do thou once more<br />
Save the squadron, honor France, love thy wife the Belle <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Aurore!</span><br />

<h2>THE SONG OF THE CAMP</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Bayard Taylor</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This is a song of the Crimean War, a war between
Russia on one side and Turkey, Great Britain,
France, and Sardinia on the other. Guarding
Sebastopol (the chief city of the Crimea) were
several forts among which were the Redan and the
Malakoff, mentioned herein. These, as well as the
works of Balaklava, were held by the Russians. It
was at Balaklava, you will recall, that the "Charge
of the Light Brigade" was made, a charge made
famous by Tennyson's poem.</p></div>


<div>
"Give us a song!" the soldiers cried,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The outer trenches guarding,</span><br />
When the heated guns of the camps allied<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Grew weary of bombarding.</span><br />
<br />
The dark Redan, in silent scoff,                          <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lay grim and threatening under;</span><br />
And the tawny mound of the Malakoff<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No longer belched its thunder.</span><br />
<br />
There was a pause. A guardsman said,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"We storm the forts to-morrow:</span><span class="linenum">10</span><br />
Sing while we may; another day<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Will bring enough of sorrow."</span><br />
<br />
They lay along the battery's side,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Below the smoking cannon&mdash;</span><br />
Brave hearts from Severn and from Clyde                  <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And from the banks of Shannon.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span><br />
They sang of love and not of fame;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Forgot was Britain's glory;</span><br />
Each heart recalled a different name,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But all sang <i>Annie Laurie</i>.</span><br />
<br />
Voice after voice caught up the song,                     <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Until its tender passion</span><br />
Rose like an anthem, rich and strong&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their battle-eve confession.</span><br />
<br />
Dear girl, her name he dared not speak,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But as the song grew louder,</span><span class="linenum">10</span><br />
Something upon the soldier's cheek<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Washed off the stains of powder.</span><br />
<br />
Beyond the darkening ocean burned<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The bloody sunset's embers,</span><br />
While the Crimean valleys learned                        <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How English love remembers.</span><br />
<br />
And once again a fire of hell<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Rained on the Russian quarters,</span><br />
With scream of shot, and burst of shell,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And bellowing of the mortars!</span><span class="linenum">20</span><br />
<br />
And Irish Nora's eyes are dim<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For a singer dumb and gory;</span><br />
And English Mary mourns for him<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who sang of <i>Annie Laurie</i>.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span><br />
Sleep, soldiers! Still in honored rest<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Your truth and valor wearing;</span><br />
The bravest are the tenderest&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The loving are the daring.</span><br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><br /><p>1. At what time of day did the singing take place?
Why, do you suppose, did the British soldiers sing
<i>Annie Laurie?</i> Repeat some of the lines of that
song.</p>

<h2>CABIN BOY AND ADMIRAL</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Sir Cloudesley Shovel (1650?-1707) was the cabin
boy of this story. He went to sea when quite young,
and by his ability and courage won constant
promotion, finally becoming admiral. In the sea
fight between the English and French at La Hogue in
1692 (see Browning's "Herv&eacute; Riel," page 307)
Shovel's was the first English ship to break
through the enemy's line.</p></div>


<p>
It was a gray autumn evening more than two hundred<br />
years ago, in the reign of King Charles II. There was<br />
the moan of a rising storm over the North Sea, and the<br />
lowering sky, the flying streamers of cloud, and the great<br />
leaden waves, heaving sullenly far as the eye could reach,<span class="linenum">5</span><br />
warned even the bravest sailor that it was a day to keep<br />
safe in port. For what ship could live in such a sea as<br />
that?<br />
</p><p>
Yet the English fleet, far from keeping in port, was<br />
beating seaward against wind and wave. On the quarter deck           <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
of the flagship stood Admiral Sir John Narborough&mdash;the<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>first seaman in England&mdash;who thirty-five years before<br />
had been a cabin boy. His daring and dauntless courage<br />
had earned for him the name of "Gunpowder Jack,"<br />
and that dark autumn day was to test how well the bold<br />
name fitted him. But he had been tried many a time, and<br />
tempest and sea and the fire of the enemy could not make  <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
his stout heart quail.<br />
</p><p>
Suddenly his grave face lighted up and his stern gray<br />
eyes sparkled with joy. Far away along the eastern sky he<br />
saw a bristling line of tall masts with a flag which he knew<br />
well floating over them. The shadow of a smile of scorn  <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
changed for a moment the expression of the admiral's<br />
face. For a moment only. There was no time for smiles.<br />
There was mighty work to be done. The floating flag told<br />
that the Dutch were coming; and that day must see the<br />
enemy of England swept from the sea or England herself   <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
forget her ancient glory.<br />
</p><p>
Next to an old friend the British sailor loves an old<br />
enemy; and as soon as the men saw the flag of Holland<br />
they were eager for battle. On came the enemy in grim<br />
silence until their nearest vessels were within musket   <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
range of the English. Then, all at once, bang! went the<br />
whole broadside from the admiral's vessel, and with a<br />
crash that seemed to echo to the sky the deadly struggle<br />
began.<br />
</p><p>
The English blood was soon up and the only thought       <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
was to fight to the last. Amid the blinding smoke, the reek<br />
of gunpowder, the thunder of cannon, and the grinding<br />
tear of the shot through the strong timbers, the sailors did<br />
noble duty that day in the dogged faith that they would<br />
"give as good as they got, anyhow!"                      <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
</p><p>
Aided by a sudden change of the wind, the Dutch vessels<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>closed around the flagship with a perfect circle of fire.<br />
Two guns were disabled, the main and mizzen masts had<br />
been shot away, and a long line of wounded and dying men<br />
were lying among the shattered rigging. The thunder from<br />
the guns on the right showed that there the English were<br />
getting the best of it; but even if help should come to the           <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
admiral from that quarter, it might come too late.<br />
</p><p>
But how should help be summoned? No signal could<br />
be seen in that smoke, and as for lowering a boat, the great<br />
waves that rushed roaring up the battered sides of the flagship<br />
were a sufficient warning against that.                  <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
</p><p>
"Lads," cried Sir John, going forward with a scrap of<br />
paper in his hand, "this order must go at once to Captain<br />
Hardy, and the only way is for one of you to swim with it.<br />
Fifty guineas to anyone that will volunteer!"<br />
</p><p>
Such a request, in the face of that boiling sea and that <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
hailstorm of shot, was little better than a sentence of<br />
death; yet before the words were well out of his mouth,<br />
half the crew stepped forward. Before any of them could<br />
speak, however, a shrill, childish voice made itself heard:<br />
"Let me go, your honor!"                                 <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
</p><p>
And there stood a ragged little cabin boy, bareheaded<br />
and barefooted, touching his forelock to Sir John, just as<br />
Sir John had touched his to the admiral, five and thirty<br />
years ago. The boy had evidently been in the thick of the<br />
fight. His hands were grimed with powder and there       <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
were splashes of blood upon his tattered clothing. But<br />
through his bright, fearless blue eyes there shone a spirit<br />
worth that of ten ordinary men.<br />
</p><p>
"You, my boy? Why, you can never swim so far in<br />
this sea, and with all that shot flying about."          <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
</p><p>
"Can't I?" echoed the boy indignantly. "I've done<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>more than that before now; and, as for the shot, I don't<br />
care <i>that</i> for it. I'm not going to sit still while everybody<br />
else is fighting the Dutch. Flog me at the gangway<br />
to-morrow, if you like, your honor, but let me do this job<br />
to-day."<br />
</p><p>
The old warrior's stern eyes glistened as if tears were   <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
forcing their way. He grasped the thin little hand in his<br />
own.<br />
</p><p>
"You're a chip of the old block," he growled, "and no<br />
mistake! Off with you, then; and may God keep you<br />
safe!"                                                   <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
</p><p>
The words were hardly spoken when the boy, thrusting<br />
the dispatch into his mouth, plunged headlong into the<br />
roaring sea. And then for fifteen fierce minutes all was<br />
one scene of fire and tumult and slaughter.<br />
</p><p>
Many a time in that terrible quarter of an hour did the  <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
weary men strain their bloodshot eyes, and strain them in<br />
vain, to catch a glimpse of English colors breaking through<br />
the smoke. "If help is to come at all, it must come soon,"<br />
said more than one worn-out sailor.<br />
</p><p>
Suddenly the admiral's grim face brightened with a       <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
light never seen there before, and he drew a long, deep<br />
breath like one shaking off a heavy burden. At the same<br />
moment there broke out a fresh thunder of guns on the<br />
right, and through the smoke burst the flag of England,<br />
sweeping all before it like mists scattered by the rising sun.       <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
</p><p>
The battle was won, and the few Dutch vessels that had<br />
escaped were disappearing in the dimness of night when the<br />
admiral and his remaining officers gathered on the quarter-deck<br />
to do honor to the little hero. He stood in their<br />
presence with a boyish smile upon his face; but when Sir <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
John held out a well-filled purse, the boy turned his head<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>proudly away.<br />
</p><p>
"Your honor, I did not do this job for money," said he<br />
firmly. "I did it for the sake of the flag and because you<br />
have been good to me. If you say you are satisfied, that<br />
is all I want."<br />
</p><p>
The listening crew, forgetting all restraint, broke into a<span class="linenum">5</span><br />
deafening cheer; and the admiral's iron face softened<br />
strangely as he laid his blackened hand on the bare white<br />
shoulder: "God bless you, my brave lad! I shall live to<br />
see you on a quarter-deck of your own yet."<br />
</p><p>
Thirty years later, when Queen Anne's greatest admiral,  <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
Sir Cloudesley Shovel, sailed up the Thames in triumph,<br />
the first to greet him as he stepped ashore was an old white-haired<br />
man who still retained traces of the fire and energy<br />
that had once distinguished "Gunpowder Jack."<br />
</p><p>
"Welcome home, my lad!" said he, heartily. "I said       <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
I'd live to see you on a quarter-deck of your own; and,<br />
thank God, I <i>have</i> lived to see you there!"<br />

<h2>LITTLE GIFFEN</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Francis O. Ticknor</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This poem is based on an actual occurrence. A lad,
nursed back to life, rejoins the hard-pressed
Southern troops and is killed in the first battle.
Ticknor (1822-1874) was a Georgian. By profession a
physician, his love of poetry led to the production
of some of the finest lyrics of the South. Among
these the best known are "Little Giffen" and "The
Virginians of the Valley."</p></div>


<div>
Out of the focal and foremost fire&mdash;<br />
Out of the hospital walls as dire&mdash;<br />
Smitten of grapeshot and gangrene&mdash;<br />
Eighteenth battle and he sixteen&mdash;<br />
Specter such as you seldom see,                           <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
Little Giffen of Tennessee.<br />
<br />
"Take him and welcome," the surgeon said;<br />
"Little the doctor can help the dead!"<br />
So we took him and brought him where<br />
The balm was sweet in our summer air;                    <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
And we laid him down on a wholesome bed&mdash;<br />
Utter Lazarus, heel to head!<br />
<br />
And we watched the war with bated breath&mdash;<br />
Skeleton boy against skeleton death!<br />
Months of torture, how many such!                        <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
Weary weeks of the stick and crutch;<br />
And still a glint in the steel-blue eye<br />
Told of a spirit that wouldn't die,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span><br />
And didn't! Nay, more! in death's despite<br />
The crippled skeleton learned to write.<br />
"Dear Mother," at first, of course; and then,<br />
"Dear Captain," inquiring about the men.<br />
Captain's answer: "Of eighty and five,                    <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
Giffen and I are left alive."<br />
<br />
Word of gloom from the war, one day:<br />
"Johnston's pressed at the front, they say!"<br />
Little Giffen was up and away;<br />
A tear&mdash;his first&mdash;as he bade good-by,                   <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
Dimmed the glint of his steel-blue eye.<br />
"I'll write, if spared." There was news of fight,<br />
But none of Giffen.&mdash;He did not write.<br />
<br />
I sometimes fancy that were I king<br />
Of the courtly knights of Arthur's Ring,                 <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
With the voice of the minstrel in mine ear<br />
And the tender legend that trembles here,<br />
I'd give the best on his bended knee&mdash;<br />
The whitest soul of my chivalry&mdash;<br />
For Little Giffen of Tennessee.                          <span class="linenum">20</span><br />

<h2>MARCO BOZZARIS</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Fitz-Greene Halleck</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Marco Bozzaris (1790-1823) was born among the
mountains of Suli, in Epirus, a province of Greece.
He had early military training in the French
service; but at the age of thirty he undertook to
battle against the Turks, who were holding the
Greeks in heavy subjection. At the head of his
countrymen, the Suliotes, he won many battles; but
finally, through treachery, he and his forces were
besieged. To relieve the siege, Bozzaris led his
troops against the enemy in a night attack and won
a complete victory, but the hero fell, dying in the
hour of triumph.</p></div>


<div>
At midnight, in his guarded tent,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Turk was dreaming of the hour</span><br />
When Greece, her knee in suppliance bent,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Should tremble at his power;</span><br />
In dreams, through camp and court, he bore                <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
The trophies of a conqueror;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In dreams, his song of triumph heard;</span><br />
Then wore his monarch's signet ring;<br />
Then pressed that monarch's throne&mdash;a king;<br />
As wild his thoughts, and gay of wing,                   <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As Eden's garden bird.</span><br />
<br />
At midnight, in the forest shades,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bozzaris ranged his Suliote band,</span><br />
True as the steel of their tried blades,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Heroes in heart and hand.</span><span class="linenum">15</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>There had the Persian's thousands stood,<br />
There had the glad earth drunk their blood,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On old Plat&aelig;a's day;</span><br />
And now, there breathed that haunted air<br />
The sons of sires who conquered there,<br />
With arm to strike, and soul to dare,                     <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As quick, as far, as they.</span><br />
<br />
An hour passed on&mdash;the Turk awoke;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That bright dream was his last;</span><br />
He woke to hear his sentries shriek,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"To arms!&mdash;they come! the Greek! the Greek!"</span><span class="linenum">10</span><br />
He woke&mdash;to die midst flame, and smoke,<br />
And shout, and groan, and saber stroke,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And death shots falling thick and fast</span><br />
As lightning from the mountain cloud&mdash;<br />
And heard, with voice as trumpet loud,                   <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bozzaris cheer his band:</span><br />
"Strike&mdash;till the last armed foe expires;<br />
Strike&mdash;for your altars and your fires;<br />
<i>Strike</i>&mdash;for the green graves of your sires,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">God&mdash;and your native land!"</span><span class="linenum">20</span><br />
<br />
They fought&mdash;like brave men, long and well;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They piled that ground with Moslem slain;</span><br />
They conquered&mdash;but Bozzaris fell<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bleeding at every vein.</span><br />
His few surviving comrades saw                           <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
His smile when rang their proud huzza<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the red field was won;</span><br />
Then saw in death his eyelids close,<br />
Calmly as to a night's repose,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like flowers at set of sun.</span><span class="linenum">30</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span><br />
Come to the bridal chamber, Death!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Come to the mother, when she feels,</span><br />
For the first time, her first-born's breath;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Come when the blessed seals</span><br />
That close the pestilence are broke,                      <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
And crowded cities wail its stroke;<br />
Come in consumption's ghastly form,<br />
The earthquake's shock, the ocean's storm;<br />
Come when the heart beats high and warm<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With banquet song, and dance, and wine,&mdash;</span><span class="linenum">10</span><br />
And thou art terrible!&mdash;The tear,<br />
The groan, the knell, the pall, the bier;<br />
And all we know, or dream, or fear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of agony are thine.</span><br />
<br />
But to the hero, when his sword                          <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Has won the battle for the free,</span><br />
Thy voice sounds like a prophet's word,<br />
And in its hollow tones are heard<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The thanks of millions yet to be.</span><br />
Bozzaris! with the storied brave                         <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Greece nurtured in her glory's time,</span><br />
Rest thee; there is no prouder grave,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Even in her own proud clime.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We tell thy doom without a sigh;</span><br />
For thou art Freedom's now, and Fame's.&mdash;                <span class="linenum">25</span><br />

<h2>SAN JUAN HILL</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By General John J. Pershing</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Santiago, Cuba, was the center of some of the
heaviest fighting of the Spanish-American War. The
Spanish fleet had taken refuge from the American
fleet in Santiago Harbor. The Spanish army had been
concentrated there to protect their fleet. The
American army, under the general command of Major
General Shafter, invested the city. The following
extract describes picturesquely the fighting three
days before the Spanish fleet put to sea.</p></div>


<p>
On June 30th the general order came to move forward<br />
and every man felt that the final test of skill at arms<br />
would soon come. The cavalry division of six regiments,<br />
camped in its tracks at midnight on El Pozo Hill, awoke<br />
next morning to find itself in support of Grimes' Battery,<span class="linenum">5</span><br />
which was to open fire here on the left.<br />
</p><p>
The morning of July 1st was ideally beautiful, the sky<br />
was cloudless and the air soft and balmy, peace seemed to<br />
reign supreme, great palms towered here and there above<br />
the low jungle. It was a picture of a peaceful valley.   <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
There was a feeling that we had secretly invaded the Holy<br />
Land. The hush seemed to pervade all nature as though<br />
she held her bated breath in anticipation of the carnage.<br />
</p><p>
Captain Capron's field guns opened fire upon the southern<br />
field at El Caney and the hill resounded with echoes.    <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
Then followed the rattle of the musketry of the attacking<br />
invaders. The firing in our front burst forth and the<br />
battle was on.<br />
</p><p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>The artillery duel began and in company with foreign<br />
military attach&eacute;s and correspondents we all sat watching<br />
the effect of the shots as men witness any friendly athletic<br />
contest, eagerly trying to locate the enemy's smokeless<br />
batteries. A force of insurgents near the old Sugar Mill<br />
applauded at the explosion of each firing charge, apparently          <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
caring for little except the noise.<br />
</p><p>
Now and then a slug of iron fell among the surrounding<br />
bushes or buried itself deep in the ground near us. Finally<br />
a projectile from an unseen Spanish gun disabled a Hotchkiss<br />
piece, wounded two cavalrymen, and smashed into the      <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
old Sugar Mill in our rear, whereupon the terrorized insurgents<br />
fled and were not seen again near the firing line until<br />
the battle was over.<br />
</p><p>
When the Tenth Cavalry arrived at the crossing of San<br />
Juan River our observation balloon had become lodged in  <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
the treetops above and the enemy had just begun to make<br />
a target of it. A converging fire upon all the works within<br />
range opened upon us that was terrible in its effect. Our<br />
mounted officers dismounted and the men stripped off at<br />
the roadside everything possible and prepared for business.          <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
</p><p>
We were posted for a time in the bed of the stream<br />
directly under the balloon, and stood in the water to our<br />
waists awaiting orders to deploy. Standing there under<br />
that galling fire of exploding shrapnel and deadly Mauser<br />
bullets the minutes seemed like hours. General Wheeler   <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
and a part of his staff stood mounted a few minutes in the<br />
middle of the stream. Just as I raised my hand to salute<br />
in moving up the stream to post the leading squadron of<br />
my regiment, a piece of bursting shell struck between his<br />
horse's feet and covered us both with water.             <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
</p><p>
Pursuant to orders, with myself as guide, the second<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>squadron of the Tenth forced its way through wire fence<br />
and almost impenetrable thicket to its position. The regiment<br />
was soon deployed as skirmishers in an opening<br />
across the river to the right of the road and, our line being<br />
partly visible from the enemy's position, their fire was<br />
turned upon us and we had to lie down in the grass a few  <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
minutes for safety. Two officers of the regiment were<br />
wounded; here and there were frequent calls for the surgeon,<br />
but no order came to move forward. Whatever may have<br />
been the intention of the commanding general as to the<br />
part to be played by the cavalry division on that day, the           <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
officers present were not long in deciding the part their<br />
command should play, and the advance began.<br />
</p><p>
White regiments, black regiments, regulars and rough<br />
riders, representing the young manhood of the North and<br />
South, fought shoulder to shoulder unmindful of race or  <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
color, unmindful of whether commanded by an ex-Confederate<br />
or not, and mindful only of their common duty as<br />
Americans.<br />
</p><p>
Through streams, tall grass, tropical undergrowth, under<br />
barbed-wire fences and over wire entanglements, regardless           <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
of casualties, up the hill to the right this gallant advance<br />
was made. As we appeared on the crest we found the<br />
Spaniards retreating only to take up a new position farther<br />
on, spitefully firing as they retired and only yielding their<br />
ground inch by inch.                                     <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
</p><p>
Our troopers halted and lay down for a moment to get<br />
a breath and in the face of continued volleys soon formed<br />
for attack on the blockhouses and intrenchments on the<br />
second hill. This attack was supported by troops including<br />
some of the Tenth who had originally moved to the left   <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
toward this second hill and had worked their way in groups,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>slipping through the tall grass and bushes, crawling when<br />
casualties came too often, courageously facing a sleet of<br />
bullets, and now hugging the steep southern declivity<br />
ready to spring forward the few remaining yards into the<br />
teeth of the enemy. The fire from the Spanish position<br />
had doubled in intensity until the popping of their rifles<span class="linenum">5</span><br />
made a continuous roar. There was a moment's lull and<br />
our line moved forward to the charge across the valley<br />
separating the two hills. Once begun it continued dauntless<br />
in its steady, dogged, persistent advance until like a<br />
mighty resistless torrent it dashed triumphant over the  <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
crest of the hill, and firing a final volley at the vanishing<br />
foe, planted the regimental colors on the enemy's breastworks<br />
and the Stars and Stripes over the blockhouse on<br />
San Juan Hill to stay.<br />
</p><p>
This was a time for rejoicing. It was glorious.          <span class="linenum">15</span><br />

<h2>BURIAL OF A SOLDIER IN FRANCE</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Gerald M. Dwyer</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This is part of a letter home from Private Dwyer,
Co. A, 121st Engineers, A. E. F. It is used here by
permission of <i>The Springfield (Mass) Republican</i>.</p></div>


<div>
Even far behind the lines of battle, in this beautiful<br />
France, little scenes take place which bring home to<br />
one the seriousness and sadness of life. Picture to yourself<br />
a dark-green hillside divided into sections by the hedge<br />
fences which the French peasant makes so much use of.     <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
In one of these fields soldiers are at work making roads and<br />
little pathways. At one end are a number of flower-covered<br />
mounds, each one marked with a wooden cross, for this<br />
particular little field is one of the American Expeditionary<br />
Force's cemeteries.                                      <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
<br />
On the day which I have in mind, a drizzling rain comes<br />
softly, though steadily, down. A number of soldiers, hardly<br />
distinguishable from the mud in which they are working,<br />
are busy leveling off the ground around a flagpole which<br />
stands in the center of the cemetery. Presently they stop<span class="linenum">15</span><br />
work and stand listening to the drumbeats which can be<br />
heard faintly in the distance. The little group gathers about<br />
the flagpole, waiting.<br />
<br />
Slowly up the roadway comes a procession headed by the<br />
band playing the sweetly solemn funeral march. Behind    <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
it is carried a plain wooden box, draped with the Stars and<br />
Stripes, while a firing squad marches in the rear. They stop<br />
at a newly dug grave and gently lower the coffin. In clear,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>concise tones the chaplain reads the funeral service. A mist<br />
seems to creep up from the valley and wisps of it wind themselves<br />
through the air. In the neighboring field the sheep<br />
who have been grazing huddle together and gaze, as only<br />
sheep can, at the performance going on near them. Like<br />
the sheep, the soldiers in the cemetery gather closer to each         <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
other, each one's eyes filled with tears, and each one conscious<br />
of a queer sensation going on within him. . . .<br />
<br />
Now the chaplain has finished, the members of the firing<br />
squad take their places. A dead silence ensues, broken by<br />
the shots of their rifles. Two more salvos are fired and the         <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
ceremony is finished. Finally, when the mist has become<br />
very dense, the clear notes of the bugle ring out, blowing<br />
taps for a soldier's last farewell sleep.<br />
<br />
You will never really appreciate the beauty and pathos<br />
of the notes of taps unless you have heard them while lying          <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
on your hard bunk some night at the end of a hard day.<br />
The music seems to say that some day things will be peaceful<br />
again, all these hardships will be merely incidents to<br />
laugh over in the happy days to come. And so, singing its<br />
farewell to you, the notes die away, leaving you to slip into        <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
the balm of sleep.<br />
<br />
The grave has now been covered and the procession and<br />
workers gone. The fields and valley seem forsaken and<br />
alone in the late afternoon. But no, there by the graves,<br />
flitting through the rain in their capes and hoods, and looking      <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
like so many little sparrows, are some little French girls,<br />
daughters of the near-by peasants. Tenderly their little<br />
hands decorate the newest grave with flowers, their tribute<br />
to one who risked all for the safety of little maidens. Thus<br />
the grave is left, heaped with green branches and flowers, a         <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
pretty resting place.<br />

<h2>AMERICA FOR ME</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Henry van Dyke</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Doctor van Dyke (1852-) is a noted clergyman,
writer, and educator. He has long been connected
with Princeton University. From 1913-1917, during
the trying period of the World War, he was United
States minister to Holland. His many visits to
Europe have served only to increase his devotion to
his native land. The following poem is a fine
expression of the genuine homesickness of the
traveled scholar for his own country. You should
read it and re-read it until it has sung itself
into your memory.</p>

<p>(From <i>The Poems of Henry van Dyke</i>. Copyright,

'Tis fine to see the Old World, and travel up and down<br />
Among the famous palaces and cities of renown,<br />
To admire the crumbly castles and the statues of the<br />

But now I think I've had enough of antiquated things.     <span class="linenum">5</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>My heart is turning home again, and there I long to be,</i></span><br />

Oh, London is a man's town, there's power in the air;    <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
And Paris is a woman's town, with flowers in her hair;<br />
And it's sweet to dream in Venice, and it's great to study<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Rome;</span><br />
But when it comes to living, there is no place like home.<br />
<br />
I like the German fir woods, in green battalions drilled;<br />
I like the gardens of Versailles with flashing fountains<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">filled;</span><br />
But, oh, to take your hand, my dear, and ramble for a day<br />
In the friendly western woodland where Nature has her     <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">way!</span><br />
<br />
I know that Europe's wonderful, yet something seems to<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">lack;</span><br />
The Past is too much with her, and the people looking back;<br />
But the glory of the Present is to make the Future free,&mdash;           <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
We love our land for what she is and what she is to be.<br />
<br />

<h2>WHAT IS AN AMERICAN?</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Hector Saint Jean de Cr&egrave;vec&#339;ur</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>De Cr&egrave;vec&#339;ur (1731-1813) was a French writer who
emigrated to America at the age of twenty-three. He
settled on a farm near the City of New York, and
came to know many of the great men of his day. For
instance, he had the friendship of Washington and
Franklin. France appointed him as her consul at New
York. In 1782 Cr&egrave;vec&#339;ur published his <i>Letters
of an American Farmer</i>. As this extract shows, it
is almost prophetic in its insight into the future.</p></div>


<p>
What then is the American, this new man? He is<br />
either a European, or the descendant of a European,<br />
hence that strange mixture of blood which you will find<br />
in no other country. I could point out to you a family<br />
whose grandfather was an Englishman, whose wife was       <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
Dutch, whose son married a French woman, and whose<br />
present four sons have now four wives of different nations.<br />
</p><p>
An American is he who, leaving behind him all his ancient<br />
prejudices and manners, receives new ones from the<br />
new mode of life he has embraced, the new government he  <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
obeys, and the new rank he holds. He becomes an American<br />
by being received in the broad lap of our great Alma Mater.<br />
Here individuals of all nations are melted into a new race<br />
of men, whose labors and posterity will one day cause<br />
great changes in the world. Americans are the western    <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
pilgrims, who are carrying along with them that great<br />
mass of arts, sciences, vigor, and industry which began<br />
long since in the East; they will finish the great circle.<br />
</p><p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>The Americans were once scattered all over Europe;<br />
in America they are incorporated into one of the finest<br />
systems of population which has ever appeared, and which<br />
will hereafter become distinct by the power of the different<br />
climates they inhabit. The American ought therefore to<br />
love his country much better than that wherein either he  <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
or his forefathers were born. Here the rewards of his<br />
industry follow with equal steps the progress of his labor;<br />
his labor is founded on the basis of nature, self-interest.<br />
Can it want a stronger allurement?<br />
</p><p>
Women and children, who before in vain demanded a        <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
morsel of bread, now gladly help their men folk to clear those<br />
fields whence exuberant crops are to arise to feed and to<br />
clothe them all, without any part being claimed either<br />
by a despotic prince, a rich abbot, or a mighty lord.<br />
</p><p>
Religion demands but little of the American: a small     <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
voluntary salary to the minister, and gratitude to God.<br />
Can he refuse these?<br />
</p><p>
The American is a new man, who acts upon new<br />
principles; he must therefore entertain new ideas and form<br />
new opinions. From involuntary idleness, servile dependence,         <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
penury, and useless labor, he has passed to toils of<br />
a very different nature, rewarded by ample subsistence.&mdash;This<br />
is an American.<br />
</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">&mdash;<i>Letters of an American Farmer.</i></span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><br /><p>1. What is Cr&egrave;vec&#339;ur's definition of an
American? How would you define an American to-day?</p>

<p>2. Explain lines 15-18, on page 336. What does the
last clause of the sentence mean?</p>

<p>3. What reasons does the author give for a great
love of country on the part of Americans? Do these
reasons still hold good?</p>

<p>4. Explain: Alma Mater, posterity, allurement,
voluntary, servile, penury, subsistence.</p></div>

<h2>THE RISING OF '76</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Thomas Buchanan Read</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Read this selection entirely through before
stopping to inquire the meaning of puzzling
passages. Then re-read it for the references not
previously clear to you. A final reading should
enable you to get the fullness of the author's
meaning. On your first reading you should be able
to determine generally when the events took place,

<div>
Out of the North the wild news came,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Far flashing on its wings of flame,</span><br />
Swift as the boreal light that flies<br />
At midnight through the startled skies.<br />
And there was tumult in the air,                          <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The fife's shrill note, the drum's loud beat</span><br />
And through the wide land everywhere<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The answering tread of hurrying feet;</span><br />
While the first oath of Freedom's gun<br />
Came on the blast of Lexington;                          <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
And Concord, roused, no longer tame,<br />
Forgot her old baptismal name,<br />
Made bare her patriot arm of power,<br />
And swelled the discord of the hour.<br />
<br />
Within its shade of elm and oak                          <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The church of Berkeley Manor stood;</span><br />
There Sunday found the rural folk,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And some esteemed of gentle blood.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>In vain their feet with loitering tread<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Passed mid the graves where rank is naught;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All could not read the lesson taught</span><br />
In that republic of the dead.<br />
<br />
How sweet the hour of Sabbath talk,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The vale with peace and sunshine full,</span><span class="linenum">5</span><br />
Where all the happy people walk,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Decked in their homespun flax and wool!</span><br />
Where youth's gay hats with blossoms bloom,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And every maid, with simple art,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wears on her breast, like her own heart,</span><span class="linenum">10</span><br />
A bud whose depths are all perfume;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While every garment's gentle stir</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is breathing rose and lavender.</span><br />
<br />
The pastor came: his snowy locks<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hallowed his brow of thought and care;</span><span class="linenum">15</span><br />
And calmly, as shepherds lead their flocks,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He led into the house of prayer.</span><br />
The pastor rose; the prayer was strong;<br />
The psalm was warrior David's song;<br />
The text, a few short words of might,&mdash;                  <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
"The Lord of hosts shall arm the right!"<br />
<br />
He spoke of wrongs too long endured,<br />
Of sacred rights to be secured;<br />
Then from his patriot tongue of flame<br />
The startling words for Freedom came.                    <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
The stirring sentences he spake<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>Compelled the heart to glow or quake,<br />
And rising on his theme's broad wing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And grasping in his nervous hand</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The imaginary battle brand,</span><br />
In face of death he dared to fling<br />
Defiance to a tyrant king.                                <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
<br />
Even as he spoke, his frame, renewed<br />
In eloquence of attitude,<br />
Rose, as it seemed, a shoulder higher;<br />
Then swept his kindling glance of fire<br />
From startled pew to breathless choir;                   <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
When suddenly his mantle wide<br />
His hands impatient flung aside,<br />
And lo! he met their wondering eyes<br />
Complete in all a warrior's guise.<br />
<br />
A moment there was awful pause,&mdash;                        <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
When Berkeley cried, "Cease, traitor! Cease!<br />
God's temple is the house of peace!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The other shouted, "Nay, not so,</span><br />
When God is with our righteous cause;<br />
His holiest places then are ours,                        <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
His temples are our forts and towers<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That frown upon the tyrant foe;</span><br />
In this, the dawn of Freedom's day,<br />
There is a time to fight and pray!"<br />
<br />
And now before the open door&mdash;                           <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The warrior priest had ordered so&mdash;</span><br />
The enlisting trumpet's sudden roar<br />
Rang through the chapel, o'er and o'er,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Its long reverberating blow,</span><br />
So loud and clear, it seemed the ear<br />
Of dusty death must wake and hear;<br />
And there the startling drum and fife<br />
Fired the living with fiercer life.<br />
<br />
While overhead, with wild increase,                       <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
Forgetting its ancient toll of peace,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The great bell swung as ne'er before.</span><br />
It seemed as it would never cease;<br />
And every word its ardor flung<br />
From off its jubilant iron tongue                        <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was, "War! War! War!"</span><br />
<br />
"Who dares?"&mdash;this was the patriot's cry,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As striding from the desk he came,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Come out with me, in Freedom's name,</span><br />
For her to live, for her to die?"                        <span class="linenum">15</span><br />

<h2>PATRICK HENRY'S SPEECH</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In March, 1775, a month before Lexington, Patrick
Henry electrified the Virginia convention with the
speech that here follows. A resolution was before
the convention "that the colony be immediately put
in a state of defence." Speaking to that resolution,
Henry thrilled the delegates with his review of
British mistreatment and his climax of "give me
liberty or give me death."</p></div>


<p>
Mr. President, it is natural for man to indulge in<br />
the illusions of hope. We are apt to shut our eyes<br />
against a painful truth, and to listen to the song of the<br />
siren till she transforms us into beasts. Is this the part of<br />
wise men engaged in the great and arduous struggle for    <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
liberty? Are we disposed to be of the number of those<br />
who, having eyes see not, and having ears hear not, the<br />
things which so nearly concern their temporal salvation?<br />
For my part, whatever anguish of spirit it may cost, I am<br />
willing to know the whole truth; to know the worst and to<span class="linenum">10</span><br />
provide for it.<br />
</p><p>
I have but one lamp by which my feet are guided and that<br />
is the lamp of experience. I know of no way of judging of<br />
the future but by the past. And judging by the past, I<br />
wish to know what there has been in the conduct of the   <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
British ministry for the last ten years to justify those hopes<br />
with which gentlemen have been pleased to solace themselves<br />
and the House. Is it that insidious smile with which<br />
our petition has been lately received? Trust it not, sir;<br />
it will prove a snare to your feet. Suffer not yourselves<span class="linenum">20</span><br />
to be betrayed with a kiss. Ask yourselves how this<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>gracious reception of our petition comports with those<br />
warlike preparations which cover our waters and darken our<br />
land. Are fleets and armies necessary to a work of love and<br />
reconciliation? Have we shown ourselves so unwilling<br />
to be reconciled that force must be called in to win back<br />
our love?                                                 <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
</p><p>
Let us not deceive ourselves, sir. These are the implements<br />
of war and subjugation, the last argument to which<br />
kings resort. I ask, sir, what means this martial array,<br />
if its purpose be not to force us to submission? Can<br />
gentlemen assign any other possible motive for it? Has   <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
Great Britain any enemy in this quarter of the world to<br />
call for all this accumulation of navies and armies? No,<br />
sir, she has none. They are meant for us. They can be<br />
meant for no other. They are sent over to bind and rivet<br />
upon us those chains which the British ministry have been<span class="linenum">15</span><br />
so long forging.<br />
</p><p>
And what have we to oppose them? Shall we try argument?<br />
Sir, we have been trying that for the last ten years.<br />
Have we anything new to offer upon the subject? Nothing.<br />
We have held the subject up in every light of which it is<span class="linenum">20</span><br />
capable; but it has been all in vain. Shall we resort to<br />
entreaty and supplication? What terms shall we find that<br />
have not been already exhausted? Let us not, I beseech<br />
you, sir, deceive ourselves longer. Sir, we have done<br />
everything that could have been done to avert the storm  <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
that is now coming on. We have petitioned, we have remonstrated,<br />
we have supplicated, we have prostrated<br />
ourselves before the throne and have implored its interposition<br />
to arrest the tyrannical hands of the ministry<br />
and Parliament.                                          <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
</p><p>
Our petitions have been slighted, our remonstrances<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>have produced additional violence and insult, our supplications<br />
have been disregarded, and we have been spurned<br />
with contempt from the foot of the throne. In vain, after<br />
these things, may we indulge the fond hope of peace and<br />
reconciliation. There is no longer any room for hope. If<br />
we wish to be free, if we mean to preserve inviolate these<span class="linenum">5</span><br />
inestimable privileges for which we have been so long contending,<br />
if we mean not basely to abandon the noble<br />
struggle in which we have been so long engaged, and which<br />
we have pledged ourselves never to abandon until the<br />
glorious object of our contest shall be obtained, we must<span class="linenum">10</span><br />
fight! I repeat, sir, we must fight! An appeal to arms<br />
and to the God of hosts is all that is left us.<br />
</p><p>
They tell us, sir, that we are weak; unable to cope with<br />
so formidable an adversary. But when shall we be<br />
stronger? Will it be the next week or the next year?     <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
Will it be when we are totally disarmed, and when a<br />
British guard shall be stationed in every house? Shall we<br />
gather strength by irresolution and inaction? Shall we<br />
acquire the means of effectual resistance by lying supinely<br />
on our backs, and hugging the delusive phantom, hope,    <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
until our enemies shall have bound us hand and foot?<br />
Sir, we are not weak if we make a proper use of those means<br />
which the God of Nature hath placed in our power.<br />
</p><p>
Three millions of people armed in the holy cause of<br />
liberty, and in such a country as that which we possess, <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
are invincible by any force which our enemy can send<br />
against us. Besides, sir, we shall not fight our battles alone.<br />
There is a just God who presides over the destinies of<br />
nations, and who will raise up friends to fight our battles<br />
for us. The battle, sir, is not to the strong alone; it is to        <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
the vigilant, the active, the brave. Besides, sir, we have<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>no election. If we were base enough to desire it, it is now<br />
too late to retire from the contest. There is no retreat<br />
but in submission and slavery! Our chains are forged.<br />
Their clanking may be heard on the plains of Boston!<br />
The war is inevitable, and let it come! I repeat, sir, let<br />
it come!                                                  <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
</p><p>
It is vain, sir, to extenuate the matter. Gentlemen may<br />
cry Peace, peace! But there is no peace. The war is<br />
actually begun! The next gale that sweeps from the North<br />
will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms! Our<br />
brethren are already in the field! Why stand we here     <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
idle? What is it that gentlemen wish? What would they<br />
have? Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased<br />
at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it,<br />
Almighty God! I know not what course others may take,<br />
but as for me, give me liberty or give me death!         <span class="linenum">15</span><br />

<h2>ABRAHAM LINCOLN TO MRS. BIXBY</h2>


<div class='right'>
<span style="margin-right: 27em;">Executive Mansion, Washington.</span><br />
<span style="margin-right: 29.5em;">November 21, 1864.</span><br /></div>
<div>
Mrs. Bixby, Boston, Massachusetts.<br />
</div>

<p>Dear Madam: I have been shown in the files of the War<br />
Department a statement of the Adjutant General of Massachusetts       <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
that you are the mother of five sons who have<br />
died gloriously on the field of battle. I feel how weak<br />
and fruitless must be any words of mine which should<br />
attempt to beguile you from the grief of a loss so overwhelming.<br />
But I cannot refrain from tendering to you the           <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
consolation that may be found in the thanks of the Republic<br />
they died to save. I pray that our heavenly Father may<br />
assuage the anguish of your bereavement, and leave you<br />
only the cherished memory of the loved and lost, and the<br />
solemn pride that must be yours to have laid so costly a <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
sacrifice upon the altar of freedom.</p>

<div class='right'>
<span style="margin-right: 35em;">Yours very sincerely and respectfully,</span><br />
<span style="margin-right: 33em;">Abraham Lincoln.</span><br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><br /><p>1. Undoubtedly the most difficult kind of letter to
write is the letter of sympathy, expressing sorrow
for loss by death. Why? Lincoln's little letter to
Mrs. Bixby has long been considered a classic of
its kind. It is sincere, sympathetic, and helpful.
What makes it so?</p>

<p>2. How did Lincoln come to write this letter? What
does the fact that he wrote it show about the man?
What was his object in writing it? Do you think he
succeeded? What consolation did he offer the
mother?</p></div>

<h2>THE FLOWER OF LIBERTY</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Oliver Wendell Holmes</span></h3>


<div>
What flower is this that greets the morn,<br />
Its hues from heaven so freshly born?<br />
With burning star and naming band<br />
It kindles all the sunset land:<br />
Oh, tell us what its name may be,&mdash;                       <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
Is this the Flower of Liberty?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It is the banner of the free,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The starry Flower of Liberty!</span><br />
<br />
In savage nature's far abode<br />
Its tender seed our fathers sowed;                       <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
The storm winds rocked its swelling bud,<br />
Its opening leaves were streaked with blood,<br />
Till lo! earth's tyrants shook to see<br />
The full-blown Flower of Liberty!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then hail the banner of the free,</span><span class="linenum">15</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The starry Flower of Liberty!</span><br />
<br />
Behold its streaming rays unite<br />
One mingling flood of braided light,&mdash;<br />
The red that fires the Southern rose,<br />
With spotless white from Northern snows,                 <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
And, spangled o'er its azure, see<br />
The sister stars of Liberty!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then hail the banner of the free,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The starry Flower of Liberty!</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span><br />
The blades of heroes fence it round,<br />
Where'er it springs in holy ground;<br />
From tower and dome its glories spread;<br />
It waves where lonely sentries tread;<br />
It makes the land as ocean free,                          <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
And plants an empire on the sea!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then hail the banner of the free,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The starry Flower of Liberty.</span><br />
<br />
Thy sacred leaves, fair Freedom's flower,<br />
Shall ever float on dome and tower,                      <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
To all their heavenly colors true,<br />
In blackening frost or crimson dew,&mdash;<br />
And God love us as we love thee,<br />
Thrice-holy Flower of Liberty!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then hail the banner of the free,</span><span class="linenum">15</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The starry Flower of Liberty.</span><br />

<h2>TRUE PATRIOTISM</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Benjamin Harrison</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Benjamin Harrison (1833-1901) was the twenty-third
President of the United States; the grandson of
President William Henry Harrison; and the
great-grandson of Benjamin Harrison, Sr., a signer
of the Declaration of Independence. He was well
qualified to speak on the subject of real
patriotism as against mere loyalty to political
party.</p></div>


<p>
Let us exalt patriotism and moderate our party contentions.<br />
Let those who would die for the flag on the<br />
field of battle give a better proof of their patriotism and a<br />
higher glory to their country by promoting fraternity and<br />
justice. A party success that is achieved by unfair methods           <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
or by practices that partake of revolution is hurtful and<br />
evanescent, even from a party standpoint. We should<br />
hold our different opinions in mutual respect; and, having<br />
submitted them to the arbitrament of the ballot, should<br />
accept an adverse judgment with the same respect that we <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
would have demanded of our opponents if the decision had<br />
been more in our favor.<br />
</p><p>
No other people have a government more worthy of their<br />
respect and love, or a land so magnificent in extent, so<br />
pleasant to look upon, and so full of generous suggestion<span class="linenum">15</span><br />
to enterprise and labor. God has placed upon our head<br />
a diadem, and has laid at our feet power and wealth beyond<br />
definition or calculation. But we must not forget that<br />
we take these gifts upon the condition that justice and<br />
mercy shall hold the reins of power, and that the upward <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>avenues of hope shall be free for all the people.<br />
</p><p>
I do not mistrust the future. Dangers have been in<br />
frequent ambush along our path, but we have uncovered<br />
and vanquished them all. Passion has swept some of our<br />
communities, but only to give us a new demonstration that<br />
the great body of our people are stable, patriotic, and law-abiding.   <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
No political party can long pursue advantage<br />
at the expense of public honor, or by rude and indecent<br />
methods, without protest and fatal disaffection in its own<br />
body. The peaceful agencies of commerce are more fully<br />
revealing the necessary unity of all our communities, and<span class="linenum">10</span><br />
the increasing intercourse of our people is promoting mutual<br />
respect. We shall find unalloyed pleasure in the revelation<br />
which our census will make of the swift development of the<br />
great resources of some of the states. Each state will<br />
bring its generous contributions to the great aggregate of           <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
the nation's increase. And when the harvests from the<br />
fields, the cattle from the hills, and the ores from the earth,<br />
shall have been weighed, counted, and valued, we will turn<br />
from all to crown with the highest honor the state that has<br />
most promoted education, virtue, justice, and patriotism <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
among its people.<br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><br /><p>1. When was Benjamin Harrison President? What did
he know about the party defeats he mentions? Was he
ever a defeated candidate?</p>

<p>2. What are the leading political parties of our
country at present? Are they essential to our form
of government? Support your answer by reasons.</p>

<p>3. Explain what Harrison meant by: "A party success
. . . achieved by unfair methods"; "the arbitrament
of the ballot"; "justice and mercy shall hold the
reins of power"; the last sentence.</p></div>

<h2>THE PROBLEMS OF THE REPUBLIC</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Theodore Roosevelt</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The following is extracted from the inaugural
address of President Roosevelt, delivered March 4,
1905. It is of special interest to read it in
connection with Mr. Hughes's speech (page 356) and
to compare the ideas of citizenship and of our
country as expressed in the two. In reading this
speech you should bear in mind that the era was one
of peace, long undisturbed by war. Our problems
then were the ordinary problems of everyday living.</p></div>


<p>
Modern life is both complex and intense, and the<br />
tremendous changes wrought by the extraordinary<br />
industrial development of the half century are felt in every<br />
fiber of our social and political being. Never before have<br />
men tried so vast and formidable an experiment as that of <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
administering the affairs of a continent under the form of a<br />
democratic republic. The conditions which have told for<br />
our marvelous material well-being, which have developed<br />
to a very high degree our energy, self-reliance, and individual<br />
initiative, also have brought the care and anxiety       <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
inseparable from the accumulation of great wealth in<br />
industrial centers.<br />
</p><p>
Upon the success of our experiment much depends, not<br />
only as regards our own welfare, but as regards the welfare<br />
of mankind. If we fail, the cause of free self-government<span class="linenum">15</span><br />
throughout the world will rock to its foundations, and<br />
therefore our responsibility is heavy, to ourselves, to the<br />
world as it is to-day, and to the generations yet unborn.<br />
</p><p>
There is no good reason why we should fear the future,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>but there is every reason why we should face it seriously,           <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
neither hiding from ourselves the gravity of the problems<br />
before us, nor fearing to approach these problems with the<br />
unbending, unflinching purpose to solve them aright.<br />
</p><p>
Yet after all, though the problems are new, though the<br />
tasks set before us differ from the tasks set before our  <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
fathers who founded and preserved this republic, the<br />
spirit in which these tasks must be undertaken and these<br />
problems faced, if our duty is to be well done, remains<br />
essentially unchanged. We know that self-government is<br />
difficult. We know that no people needs such high traits <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
of character as that people which seeks to govern its affairs<br />
aright through the freely expressed will of the free men who<br />
compose it.<br />
</p><p>
But we have faith that we shall not prove false to memories<br />
of the men of the mighty past. They did their work;      <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
they left us the splendid heritage we now enjoy. We in our<br />
turn have an assured confidence that we shall be able to leave<br />
this heritage unwasted and enlarged to our children's children.<br />
</p><p>
To do so, we must show, not merely in great crises, but<br />
in the everyday affairs of life, the qualities of practical          <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
intelligence, of courage, of hardihood, of endurance, and<br />
above all, the power of devotion to a lofty ideal, which<br />
made great the men who founded this republic in the days<br />
of Washington; which made great the men who preserved<br />
this republic in the days of Abraham Lincoln.            <span class="linenum">25</span><br />

<p>2. Find in this section of your Reader expressions
similar to lines 10-13, page 355.</p>

<h2>THE MEANING OF AMERICANISM</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Charles Evans Hughes</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Charles Evans Hughes (1862- ) has had a conspicuous
political career. He has been successively governor
of New York for two terms, a justice of the Supreme
Court; Republican nominee for the Presidency; and
Secretary of State.</p>

<p>At the time of the delivery of this speech Europe
was in the throes of the World War. America was
soon to join forces with the Allies against
Germany. This extract from Mr. Hughes's speech
should be read with the spirit of portending war in
mind. But the four-square interpretation of
Americanism that is herein set forth holds to-day
with as much force as in 1916. Read the selection
especially to get the notion of an ideal America
and the ideal citizen.</p></div>


<p>
We want something more than thrills in our patriotism&mdash;we<br />
want thought; we want intelligence&mdash;a<br />
new birth of the sentiment of unity in the nation.<br />
</p><p>
My dream of America is America represented in public<br />
office by its best men working entirely for the good of the           <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
Republic and according to the laws and ordinances established<br />
by the people for the government of their conduct,<br />
and not for personal or political desires and ambitions;<br />
America working her institutions as they were intended to<br />
be worked, with men whose sole object shall be to secure <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
the end for which the offices were designed.<br />
</p><p>
And if one will throw his personal fortunes to the winds,<br />
if he will perform in each place, high or low, the manifest<br />
obligations of that place, we will soon have those victories<br />
of democracy which will make the Fourth of July in its   <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
coming years a far finer and nobler day than it has ever<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>been in the fortunate years of the past.<br />
</p><p>
When we are thinking of the ideals of democracy, we<br />
are thinking of the schools, and we deplore every condition<br />
in which we find man lower than he should be under a free<br />
government, and we want greater victories of democracy,<br />
that the level of success shall be raised.                <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
</p><p>
We are not a rash people; we are not filled with the<br />
spirit of militarism. We are not anxious to get into trouble,<br />
but if anybody thinks that the spirit of service and sacrifice<br />
is lost and that we have not the old sentiment of self-respect,<br />

</p><p>
We want patriotism, and I don't think that we are going<br />
to lose it very soon, although I do devoutly hope that out<br />
of the perils and difficulties of this time may come a new<br />
birth of the sentiment of unity. I do hope that in the<br />
midst of all these troublesome conditions we will have a <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
better realization of our national strength and the import<br />
of our democratic institutions.<br />
</p><p>
The boy is going to thrill at the sight of the flag to-day<br />
just as he did fifty years or one hundred years ago. We<br />
are all going to thrill when we hear the words of our    <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
national hymn and we think of the long years of struggle<br />
and determination that have brought us to this hour. But<br />
we want something more than thrills in our patriotism:<br />
we want thought; we want intelligence.<br />
</p><p>
Not vast extent of territory, not great population, not  <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
simply extraordinary statistics of national wealth, although<br />
they speak in eloquent words of energy and managing<br />
ability; but what we need more than anything else is an<br />
intelligent comprehension of the ideals of democracy.<br />
Those ideals are that every man shall have a fair and equal          <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
chance according to his talents. It is not an ideal of democracy<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>that one alone shall emerge because of conspicuous<br />
ability, but that there shall be a great advance of the plain<br />
people of the country, upon whom the prosperity of the<br />
country depends.<br />
</p><p>
It is all very well to talk about the Declaration of Independence<br />
and the strong sentiments it contains, but that           <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
was backed by men who couldn't have committed it to<br />
memory, men who couldn't have repeated it, but men in<br />
whose lives was the incarnation of independence and whose<br />
spirit was breathed into that immortal document.<br />
</p><p>
It is because we had men who were willing to suffer, to  <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
die, to venture, to sacrifice, that we have a country, and<br />
it is only by that spirit that we will ever be able to keep a<br />
country. I love to think of those hardy men coming here<br />
with the same spirit that led the pioneers to the West and<br />
Farther West, the same spirit which in every part of our <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
land has accounted for our development.<br />
</p><p>
Quiet men, not noisy men; sensible men, not foolish<br />
men; straight men, honest men, dependable men, real<br />
men&mdash;that is what we mean by Americanism.<br />

<h2>WHAT CONSTITUTES A STATE?</h2>

<h2>THE LISTS AT ASHBY</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Sir Walter Scott</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The following is the larger part of chapter eight
of Scott's <i>Ivanhoe</i>. The hero of the novel is a
Saxon knight, Wilfred of Ivanhoe, son of Cedric.
Ivanhoe is in love with his father's ward, Rowena,
but Cedric wishes her to marry a thick-headed Saxon
thane, or lord, called Athelstane. According to
Scott, the period was one of unrest. England had
come into the possession of the Normans, and the
native Saxons hated their new masters. Richard was
king. But since he had gone to the Holy Land as a
leader in one of the crusades, his brother, Prince
John, ruled in his stead. Both were foreigners, but
the common people liked Richard and hated John, who
was not only a tyrant, but was also planning to
seize his brother's throne. He had had Richard
imprisoned in Austria, and had surrounded himself
with ambitious and dissatisfied Norman knights. The
tournament at Ashby was really a trial at arms
between the Prince's followers and those of
Richard, of whom Ivanhoe was one.</p></div>


<p>
The lists now presented a most splendid spectacle.<br />
The sloping galleries were crowded with all that was<br />
noble, great, wealthy, and beautiful in the northern and<br />
midland parts of England; and the contrast of the various<br />
dresses of these dignified spectators rendered the view as<span class="linenum">5</span><br />
gay as it was rich, while the interior and lower space, filled<br />
with the substantial burgesses and yeomen of merry England,<br />
formed, in their more plain attire, a dark fringe, or<br />
border, around this circle of brilliant embroidery, relieving,<br />
and at the same time setting off, its splendor.          <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
</p><p>
The heralds finished their proclamation with their usual<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>cry of "Largess, largess, gallant knights!" and gold and<br />
silver pieces were showered on them from the galleries,<br />
it being a high point of chivalry to exhibit liberality toward<br />
those whom the age accounted at once the secretaries and<br />
the historians of honor. The bounty of the spectators<br />
was acknowledged by the customary shouts of "Love of      <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
Ladies&mdash;Death of Champions&mdash;Honor to the Generous&mdash;Glory<br />
to the Brave!" To which the more humble<br />
spectators added their acclamations, and a numerous band<br />
of trumpeters the flourish of their martial instruments.<br />
When these sounds had ceased, the heralds withdrew from  <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
the lists in gay and glittering procession, and none remained<br />
within them save the marshals of the field, who, armed cap-a-pie,<br />
sat on horseback, motionless as statues, at the opposite<br />
ends of the lists.<br />
</p><p>
Meantime, the inclosed space at the northern extremity   <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
of the lists, large as it was, was now completely crowded<br />
with knights desirous to prove their skill against the challengers,<br />
and when viewed from the galleries presented the<br />
appearance of a sea of waving plumage intermixed with<br />
glistening helmets and tall lances, to the extremities of<span class="linenum">20</span><br />
which were, in many cases, attached small pennons of<br />
about a span's breadth, which, fluttering in the air as the<br />
breeze caught them, joined with the restless motion of the<br />
feathers to add liveliness to the scene.<br />
</p><p>
At length the barriers were opened, and five knights     <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
chosen by lot advanced slowly into the area; a single champion<br />
riding in front and the other four following in pairs.<br />
All were splendidly armed, and my Saxon authority records<br />
at great length their devices, their colors, and the embroidery<br />
of their horse trappings. It is unnecessary to be        <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
particular on these subjects. To borrow lines from a<br />
contemporary poet, who has written but too little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>&mdash;<br />
</p>

<div>
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">"The knights are dust,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">And their good swords are rust,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">Their souls are with the saints, we trust."</span><br />
</div>

<p>
Their escutcheons have long moldered from the walls of<br />
their castles. Their castles themselves are but green     <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
mounds and shattered ruins&mdash;the place that once knew<br />
them knows them no more&mdash;nay, many a race since theirs<br />
has died out and been forgotten in the very land which they<br />
occupied with all the authority of feudal lords. What,<br />
then, would it avail the reader to know their names or the           <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
evanescent symbols of their martial rank!<br />
</p><p>
Now, however, no whit anticipating the oblivion which<br />
awaited their names and feats, the champions advanced<br />
through the lists, restraining their fiery steeds and compelling<br />
them to move slowly, while, at the same time, they       <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
exhibited their paces, together with the grace and dexterity<br />
of the riders. As the procession entered the lists, the sound<br />
of a wild barbaric music was heard from behind the tents of<br />
the challengers, where the performers were concealed. It<br />
was of Eastern origin, having been brought from the Holy <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
Land; and the mixture of the cymbals and bells seemed to<br />
bid welcome at once, and defiance, to the knights as they<br />
advanced.<br />
</p><p>
With the eyes of an immense concourse of spectators<br />
fixed upon them, the five knights advanced up the platform           <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
upon which the tents of the challengers stood, and<br />
there separating themselves, each touched slightly, and<br />
with the reverse of his lance, the shield of the antagonist to<br />
whom he wished to oppose himself. The lower orders of<br />
spectators in general&mdash;nay, many of the higher class, and<span class="linenum">30</span><br />
it is even said several of the ladies&mdash;were rather disappointed<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>at the champions choosing the arms of courtesy.<br />
For the same sort of persons who, in the present day, applaud<br />
most highly the deepest tragedies were then interested in a<br />
tournament exactly in proportion to the danger incurred by<br />
the champions engaged.<br />
</p><p>
Having intimated their more pacific purpose, the champions<span class="linenum">5</span><br />
retreated to the extremity of the lists, where they<br />
remained drawn up in a line; while the challengers, sallying<br />
each from his pavilion, mounted their horses, and<br />
headed by Brian de Bois-Guilbert, descended from the<br />
platform and opposed themselves individually to the knights          <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
who had touched their respective shields.<br />
</p><p>
At the flourish of clarions and trumpets they started out<br />
against each other at full gallop; and such was the superior<br />
dexterity or good fortune of the challengers that those<br />
opposed to Bois-Guilbert, Malvoisin, and Front-de-B&#339;uf,  <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
rolled on the ground. The antagonist of Grantmesnil,<br />
instead of bearing his lance point fair against the crest or<br />
the shield of his enemy, swerved so much from the direct<br />
line as to break the weapon athwart the person of his opponent&mdash;a<br />
circumstance which was accounted more disgraceful        <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
than that of being actually unhorsed; because the<br />
latter might happen from accident, whereas the former<br />
evinced awkwardness and want of management of the<br />
weapon and of the horse. The fifth knight alone maintained<br />
the honor of his party and parted fairly with the        <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
Knight of St. John, both splintering their lances without<br />
advantage on either side.<br />
</p><p>
The shouts of the multitude, together with the acclamations<br />
of the heralds and the clangor of the trumpets,<br />
announced the triumph of the victors and the defeat of   <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
the vanquished. The former retreated to their pavilions,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>and the latter, gathering themselves up as they could,<br />
withdrew from the lists in disgrace and dejection, to agree<br />
with their victors concerning the redemption of their arms<br />
and their horses, which, according to the laws of the<br />
tournament, they had forfeited. The fifth of their number<br />
alone tarried in the lists long enough to be greeted by the           <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
applauses of the spectators, amongst whom he retreated, to<br />
the aggravation, doubtless, of his companions' mortification.<br />
</p><p>
A second and a third party of knights took the field; and<br />
although they had various success, yet, upon the whole,<br />
the advantage decidedly remained with the challengers,   <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
not one of whom lost his seat or swerved from his charge&mdash;misfortunes<br />
which befell one or two of their antagonists<br />
in each encounter. The spirits, therefore, of those opposed<br />
to them seemed to be considerably dampened by their continued<br />
success. Three knights only appeared on the fourth       <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
entry, who, avoiding the shields of Bois-Guilbert and<br />
Front-de-B&#339;uf, contented themselves with touching those<br />
of the three other knights, who had not altogether manifested<br />
the same strength and dexterity. This politic selection<br />
did not alter the fortune of the field: the challengers  <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
were still successful. One of their antagonists was overthrown<br />
and both the others failed in the attaint, that is,<br />
in striking the helmet and shield of their antagonist firmly<br />
and strongly with the lance held in a direct line, so that the<br />
weapon might break unless the champion was overthrown.   <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
</p><p>
After this fourth encounter, there was a considerable<br />
pause; nor did it appear that anyone was very desirous<br />
of renewing the contest. The spectators murmured among<br />
themselves; for, among the challengers, Malvoisin and<br />
Front-de-B&#339;uf were unpopular from their characters, and  <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
the others, except Grantmesnil, were disliked as strangers<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>and foreigners.<br />
</p><p>
But none shared the general feeling of dissatisfaction<br />
so keenly as Cedric the Saxon, who saw, in each advantage<br />
gained by the Norman challengers, a repeated triumph<br />
over the honor of England. His own education had taught<br />
him no skill in the games of chivalry, although, with the <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
arms of his Saxon ancestors, he had manifested himself on<br />
many occasions a brave and determined soldier.<br />
</p><p>
He looked anxiously to Athelstane, who had learned the<br />
accomplishments of the age, as if desiring that he should<br />
make some personal effort to recover the victory which was           <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
passing into the hands of the Templar and his associates.<br />
But, though both stout of heart and strong of person,<br />
Athelstane had a disposition too inert and unambitious to<br />
make the exertions which Cedric seemed to expect from<br />
him.                                                     <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
</p><p>
"The day is against England, my lord," said Cedric, in<br />
a marked tone; "are you not tempted to take the lance?"<br />
</p><p>
"I shall tilt to-morrow," answered Athelstane, "in the<br />
<i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i>; it is not worth while for me to arm myself to-day."<br />
</p><p>
Two things displeased Cedric in this speech. It contained<span class="linenum">20</span><br />
the Norman word <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i> (to express the general<br />
conflict), and it evinced some indifference to the honor of<br />
the country; but it was spoken by Athelstane, whom he<br />
held in such profound respect that he would not trust himself<br />
to canvass his motives or his foibles. Moreover, he      <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
had no time to make any remark, for Wamba thrust in his<br />
word, observing, "It was better, though scarce easier, to be<br />
the best man among a hundred than the best man of<br />
two."<br />
</p><p>
Athelstane took the observation as a serious compliment; <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
but Cedric, who better understood the jester's meaning,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>darted at him a severe and menacing look; and lucky it<br />
was for Wamba, perhaps, that the time and place prevented<br />
his receiving, notwithstanding his place and service, more<br />
sensible marks of his master's resentment.<br />
</p><p>
The pause in the tournament was still uninterrupted,<br />
excepting by the voices of the heralds exclaiming&mdash;"Love  <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
of ladies, splintering of lances! Stand forth, gallant knights,<br />
fair eyes look upon your deeds!"<br />
</p><p>
The music also of the challengers breathed from time to<br />
time wild bursts expressive of triumph or defiance, while<br />
the clowns grudged a holiday which seemed to pass away   <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
in inactivity; and old knights and nobles lamented in<br />
whispers the decay of martial spirit, spoke of the triumphs<br />
of their younger days, but agreed that the land did not now<br />
supply dames of such transcendent beauty as had animated<br />
the justs of former times.                               <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
</p><p>
Prince John began to talk to his attendants about making<br />
ready the banquet, and the necessity of adjudging the<br />
prize to Brian de Bois-Guilbert who had, with a single<br />
spear, overthrown two knights and foiled a third.<br />
</p><p>
At length, as the Saracenic music of the challengers concluded       <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
one of those high and long flourishes with which<br />
they had broken the silence of the lists, it was answered<br />
by a solitary trumpet, which breathed a note of defiance<br />
from the northern extremity. All eyes were turned to see<br />
the new champion which these sounds announced, and no    <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
sooner were the barriers opened than he paced into the<br />
lists.<br />
</p><p>
As far as could be judged from a man sheathed in armor,<br />
the new adventurer did not greatly exceed the middle size<br />
and seemed to be rather slender than strongly made.      <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
His suit of armor was formed of steel, richly inlaid with<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>gold, and the device on his shield was a young oak tree<br />
pulled up by the roots with the Spanish word <i>Desdichado</i>,<br />
signifying "disinherited". He was mounted on a gallant<br />
black horse, and as he passed through the lists he gracefully<br />
saluted the prince and the ladies by lowering his<br />
lance. The dexterity with which he managed his steed,     <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
and something of youthful grace which he displayed in his<br />
manner, won him the favor of the multitude, which some<br />
of the lower class expressed by calling out, "Touch Ralph<br />
de Vipont's shield&mdash;touch the Hospitaler's shield; he<br />
has the least sure seat; he is your cheapest bargain."   <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
</p><p>
The champion, moving onward amid these well-meant<br />
hints, ascended the platform by the sloping alley which<br />
led to it from the lists, and to the astonishment of all<br />
present, riding straight up to the central pavilion, struck<br />
with the sharp end of his spear the shield of Brian de   <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
Bois-Guilbert until it rang again.<br />
</p><p>
All stood astonished at his presumption, but none more<br />
than the redoubted knight whom he had thus defied to<br />
mortal combat and who, little expecting so rude a challenge,<br />
was standing carelessly at the door of the pavilion.     <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
</p><p>
"Have you confessed yourself, brother," said the Templar,<br />
"and have you heard Mass this morning, that you<br />
peril your life so frankly?"<br />
</p><p>
"I am fitter to meet death than thou art," answered the<br />
Disinherited Knight; for by this name the stranger had   <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
recorded himself in the books of the tourney.<br />
</p><p>
"Then take your place in the lists," said Bois-Guilbert,<br />
"and look your last upon the sun; for this night thou shalt<br />
sleep in Paradise."<br />
</p><p>
"Gramercy for thy courtesy," replied the Disinherited    <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
Knight, "and to requite it, I advise thee to take a fresh<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>horse and a new lance, for by my honor you will need both."<br />
</p><p>
Having expressed himself thus confidently, he reined his<br />
horse backward down the slope which he had ascended and<br />
compelled him in the same manner to move backward<br />
through the lists till he reached the northern extremity,<br />
where he remained stationary in expectation of his antagonist.        <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
This feat of horsemanship again attracted the applause<br />
of the multitude.<br />
</p><p>
However incensed at his adversary for the precautions<br />
which he recommended, Brian de Bois-Guilbert did not<br />
neglect his advice; for his honor was too nearly concerned           <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
to permit his neglecting any means which might insure<br />
victory over his presumptuous opponent. He changed<br />
his horse for a proved and fresh one of great strength and<br />
spirit. He chose a new and tough spear, lest the wood of<br />
the former might have been strained in the previous encounters       <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
he had sustained. Lastly, he laid aside his shield,<br />
which had received some little damage, and received another<br />
from his squires. His first had only borne the general<br />
device of his order, representing two knights riding upon one<br />
horse, an emblem expressive of the original humility and <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
poverty of the Templars, qualities which they had since<br />
exchanged for the arrogance and wealth that finally occasioned<br />
their suppression. Bois-Guilbert's new shield bore<br />
a raven in full flight, holding in its claws a skull, and bearing<br />
the motto <i>Gare le Corbeau</i>.                        <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
</p><p>
When the two champions stood opposed to each other<br />
at the two extremities of the lists, the public expectation<br />
was strained to the highest pitch. Few augured the possibility<br />
that the encounter could terminate well for the<br />
Disinherited Knight, yet his courage and gallantry secured           <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
the general good wishes of the spectators.<br />
</p><p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>The trumpets had no sooner given the signal than the<br />
champions vanished from their posts with the speed of<br />
lightning and closed in the center of the lists with the<br />
shock of a thunderbolt. The lances burst into shivers up<br />
to the very grasp and it seemed at the moment that both<br />
knights had fallen, for the shock had made each horse recoil          <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
backwards upon its haunches. The address of the riders<br />
recovered their steeds by use of the bridle and spur; and<br />
having glared on each other for an instant with eyes which<br />
seemed to flash fire through the bars of their visors, each<br />
made a demivolt, and retiring to the extremity of the    <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
lists, received a fresh lance from the attendants.<br />
</p><p>
A loud shout from the spectators, waving of scarfs and<br />
handkerchiefs, and general acclamations, attested the interest<br />
taken by the spectators in this encounter; the most equal,<br />
as well as the best performed, which had graced the day. <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
But no sooner had the knights resumed their station<br />
than the clamor of applause was hushed into a silence so<br />
deep and so dead that it seemed the multitude were afraid<br />
even to breathe.<br />
</p><p>
A few minutes' pause having been allowed, that the       <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
combatants and their horses might recover breath, Prince<br />
John with his truncheon signed to the trumpets to sound<br />
the onset. The champions a second time sprung from their<br />
stations and closed in the center of the lists, with the same<br />
speed, the same dexterity, the same violence, but not the<span class="linenum">25</span><br />
same equal fortune as before.<br />
</p><p>
In this second encounter, the Templar aimed at the center<br />
of his antagonist's shield and struck it so fair and forcibly<br />
that his spear went to shivers, and the Disinherited Knight<br />
reeled in his saddle. On the other hand, that champion   <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
had, in the beginning of his career, directed the point of his<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>lance toward Bois-Guilbert's shield, but changing his aim<br />
almost in the moment of encounter, he addressed it to the<br />
helmet, a mark more difficult to hit, but which, if attained,<br />
rendered the shock more irresistible. Fair and true, he<br />
hit the Norman on the visor, where his lance's point kept<br />
hold of the bars.                                         <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
</p><p>
Yet, even at this disadvantage, the Templar sustained<br />
his high reputation; and had not the girths of his saddle<br />
burst, he might not have been unhorsed. As it chanced,<br />
however, saddle, horse, and man rolled on the ground under<br />
a cloud of dust.                                         <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
</p><p>
To extricate himself from the stirrups and fallen steed<br />
was to the Templar scarce the work of a moment; and,<br />
stung with madness, both at his disgrace and at the acclamations<br />
with which it was hailed by the spectators, he<br />
drew his sword and waved it in defiance of his conqueror.<span class="linenum">15</span><br />
The Disinherited Knight sprang from his steed and also<br />
unsheathed his sword. The marshals of the field, however,<br />
spurred their horses between them and reminded them<br />
that the laws of the tournament did not, on the present<br />
occasion, permit this species of encounter.              <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
</p><p>
"We shall meet again, I trust," said the Templar,<br />
casting a resentful glance at his antagonist; "and where<br />
there are none to separate us."<br />
</p><p>
"If we do not," said the Disinherited Knight, "the fault<br />
shall not be mine. On foot or horseback, with spear,     <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
with ax, or with sword, I am alike ready to encounter thee."<br />
</p><p>
More and angrier words would have been exchanged,<br />
but the marshals, crossing their lances betwixt them,<br />
compelled them to separate. The Disinherited Knight<br />
returned to his first station, and Bois-Guilbert to his  <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
tent, where he remained for the rest of the day in an<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>agony of despair.<br />
</p><p>
Without alighting from his horse, the conqueror called<br />
for a bowl of wine, and opening the beaver, or lower part<br />
of his helmet, announced that he quaffed it "To all true<br />
English hearts, and to the confusion of foreign tyrants."<br />
He then commanded his trumpet to sound a defiance to      <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
the challengers, and desired a herald to announce to them<br />
that he should make no election, but was willing to encounter<br />
them in the order in which they pleased to advance<br />
against him.<br />
</p><p>
The gigantic Front-de-B&#339;uf, armed in sable armor, was    <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
the first who took the field. He bore on a white shield a<br />
black bull's head, half defaced by the numerous encounters<br />
which he had undergone, and bearing the arrogant motto,<br />
<i>Cave, adsum</i>. Over this champion the Disinherited<br />
Knight obtained a slight but decisive advantage. Both    <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
knights broke their lances fairly, but Front-de-B&#339;uf, who<br />
lost a stirrup in the encounter, was adjudged to have the<br />
disadvantage.<br />
</p><p>
In the stranger's third encounter, with Sir Philip Malvoisin,<br />
he was equally successful; striking that baron so        <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
forcibly on the casque that the laces of the helmet broke,<br />
and Malvoisin, only saved from falling by being unhelmeted,<br />
was declared vanquished like his companions.<br />
</p><p>
In his fourth combat, with De Grantmesnil, the Disinherited<br />
Knight showed as much courtesy as he had                 <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
hitherto evinced courage and dexterity. De Grantmesnil's<br />
horse, which was young and violent, reared and plunged in<br />
the course of the career so as to disturb the rider's aim,<br />
and the stranger, declining to take the advantage which<br />
this accident afforded him, raised his lance, and passing<span class="linenum">30</span><br />
his antagonist without touching him, wheeled his horse<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>and rode back again to his own end of the lists, offering<br />
his antagonist, by a herald, the chance of a second encounter.<br />
This De Grantmesnil declined, avowing himself<br />
vanquished as much by the courtesy as by the address of<br />
his opponent.<br />
</p><p>
Ralph de Vipont summed up the list of the stranger's      <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
triumphs, being hurled to the ground with such force that<br />
the blood gushed from his nose and his mouth and he was<br />
borne senseless from the lists.<br />
</p><p>
The acclamations of thousands applauded the unanimous<br />
award of the prince and marshals, announcing that day's  <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
honors to the Disinherited Knight.<br />

<h2>THE TWENTY-THIRD PSALM</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Bible serves, first, as a great religious
teacher. Second, it stands as a model of literature
whose greatness is everywhere acknowledged. Men
like John Bunyan and Abraham Lincoln learned to
write their beautiful prose through their close,
continued reading of the Scriptures. No finer
poetry exists than the Psalms of David, among which
the following is a favorite.</p></div>


<p>
The Lord is my shepherd: I shall not want.<br />
</p><p>
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: He<br />
leadeth me beside the still waters.<br />
</p><p>
He restoreth my soul: He leadeth me in the paths of<br />
righteousness for His name's sake.                        <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
</p><p>
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of<br />
death, I will fear no evil: for Thou art with me; Thy<br />
rod and Thy staff they comfort me.<br />
</p><p>
Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine<br />
enemies: Thou anointest my head with oil; my cup         <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
runneth over.<br />
</p><p>
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of<br />
my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.<br />

<h2>DOUBTING CASTLE</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By John Bunyan</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Books are like men: great ones are rare.
Occasionally a book is written that affects the
thinking of people for centuries. To this class
belongs John Bunyan's <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i>,
published 1678-1684.</p>

<p>It is the story of the journey of a man named
Christian the Pilgrim, who travels from the City of
Destruction to the Holy City. On this journey
Christian is beset by all manner of terrors,
temptations, and evils. The story is an allegory,
portraying life and its struggles if one attempts
to live righteously. Its language is that of the
Bible. Its dialogue and characters seem real, and
its narrative is full of action.</p></div>


<p>
Now I beheld in my dream that Christian and Hopeful<br />
had not journeyed far until they came where<br />
the river and the way parted, at which they were not a<br />
little sorry; yet they durst not go out of the way. Now<br />
the way from the river was rough, and their feet tender   <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
by reason of their travel; so the souls of the pilgrims were<br />
much discouraged because of the way. Wherefore, still<br />
as they went on, they wished for a better way.<br />
</p><p>
Now, a little before them, there was on the left hand of<br />
the road a meadow, and a stile to go over into it; and that          <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
meadow is called Bypath Meadow. Then said Christian<br />
to his fellow, "If this meadow lieth along by our wayside,<br />
let us go over into it." Then he went to the stile to see,<br />
and behold a path lay along by the way on the other side<br />
of the fence.                                            <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
</p><p>
"'Tis according to my wish," said Christian; "here is<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>the easiest going; come, good Hopeful, and let us go over."<br />
</p><p>
"But how if this path should lead us out of the way?"<br />
</p><p>
"That is not likely," said the other. "Look, doth it<br />
not go along by the wayside?"<br />
</p><p>
So Hopeful, being persuaded by his fellow, went after<br />
him over the stile. When they were gone over, and were    <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
got into the path, they found it very easy for their feet;<br />
and withal they, looking before them, espied a man walking<br />
as they did, and his name was Vain-Confidence: so<br />
they called after him, and asked him whither that way<br />
led.                                                     <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
</p><p>
He said, "To the Celestial Gate."<br />
</p><p>
"Look," said Christian, "did not I tell you so? By<br />
this you may see we are right."<br />
</p><p>
So they followed, and he went before them. But,<br />
behold, the night came on, and it grew very dark; so that<span class="linenum">15</span><br />
they who were behind lost sight of him that went before.<br />
He, therefore, that went before&mdash;Vain-Confidence by<br />
name&mdash;not seeing the way before him, fell into a deep<br />
pit and was dashed in pieces with his fall.<br />
</p><p>
Now Christian and his fellow heard him fall; so they     <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
called to know the matter. But there was no answer,<br />
only they heard a groan.<br />
</p><p>
Then said Hopeful, "Where are we now?"<br />
</p><p>
Then was his fellow silent, as mistrusting that he had<br />
led him out of the way; and now it began to rain and     <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
thunder and lightning in a most dreadful manner, and the<br />
water rose amain, by reason of which the way of going<br />
back was very dangerous.<br />
</p><p>
Yet they adventured to go back; but it was so dark<br />
and the flood so high, that in their going back they had <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
like to have been drowned nine or ten times. Neither<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>could they, with all the skill they had, get back again to<br />
the stile that night. Wherefore, at last lighting under a<br />
little shelter, they sat down there until daybreak. But<br />
being weary, they fell asleep.<br />
</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>
Now there was, not far from the place where they lay,<br />
a castle, called Doubting Castle, the owner whereof was   <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
Giant Despair; and it was in his grounds they now were<br />
sleeping. Wherefore he, getting up in the morning early,<br />
and walking up and down in his fields, caught Christian<br />
and Hopeful asleep in his grounds. Then with a grim and<br />
surly voice he bid them awake, and asked them whence     <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
they were and what they did in his grounds.<br />
</p><p>
They told him they were pilgrims, and that they had<br />
lost their way.<br />
</p><p>
Then said the giant, "You have this night trespassed<br />
on me, by trampling in and lying on my grounds, and therefore        <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
you must go along with me."<br />
</p><p>
So they were forced to go, because he was stronger<br />
than they. They also had but little to say, for they<br />
knew themselves in a fault. The giant, therefore, drove<br />
them before him and put them into his castle, in a very  <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
dark dungeon.<br />
</p><p>
Here, then, they lay from Wednesday morning till Saturday<br />
night, without one bit of bread, or drop of drink, or<br />
light, or any to ask how they did: they were, therefore,<br />
here in evil case, and were far from friends and acquaintance.       <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
</p><p>
Now Giant Despair had a wife, and her name was Diffidence.<br />
So, when he was gone to bed, he told his wife that<br />
he had taken a couple of prisoners, and had cast them into<br />
his dungeon for trespassing on his grounds. Then he asked<br />
her also what he had best do to them. So she asked him   <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>what they were, whence they came, and whither they<br />
were bound; and he told her. Then she counseled him<br />
that when he arose in the morning he should beat them<br />
without mercy.<br />
</p><p>
So when he arose, he getteth him a grievous crab-tree<br />
cudgel, and goes into the dungeon to them, and there first<span class="linenum">5</span><br />
falls to rating of them as if they were dogs, although they<br />
never gave him an unpleasant word. Then he fell upon<br />
them and beat them fearfully, in such sort that they were<br />
not able to help themselves or to turn them upon the floor.<br />
This done he withdraws and leaves them there to condole  <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
their misery and to mourn under their distress. So all<br />
that day they spent their time in nothing but sighs and<br />
bitter lamentations.<br />
</p><p>
The next night she, talking with her husband further<br />
about them, and understanding that they were yet alive,  <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
did advise him to counsel them to make away with themselves.<br />
</p><p>
So, when morning was come, he goes to them in a<br />
surly manner as before, and perceiving them to be very<br />
sore with the stripes that he had given them the day before,         <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
he told them that, since they were never like to come out<br />
of that place, their only way would be forthwith to make<br />
an end of themselves, either with knife, halter, or poison.<br />
"For why," he said, "should you choose to live, seeing it<br />
is attended with so much bitterness?"                    <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
</p><p>
But they desired him to let them go. With that he<br />
looked ugly upon them, and rushing to them, had doubtless<br />
made an end of them himself, but that he fell into<br />
one of his fits and lost for a time the use of his hands.<br />
Wherefore he withdrew, and left them, as before, to      <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
consider what to do.<br />
</p><p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>Then did the prisoners consult between themselves,<br />
whether it was best to take his counsel or no. But they<br />
soon resolved to reject it; for it would be very wicked to<br />
kill themselves; and, besides, something might soon<br />
happen to enable them to make their escape.<br />
</p><p>
Well, towards evening the giant goes down to the dungeon  <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
again, to see if his prisoners had taken his counsel; but<br />
when he came there, he found them alive. I say, he found<br />
them alive; at which he fell into a grievous rage, and told<br />
them that, seeing they had disobeyed his counsel, it should<br />
be worse with them than if they had never been born.     <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
</p><p>
At this they trembled greatly, and I think that Christian<br />
fell into a swoon; but, coming a little to himself again,<br />
they renewed their discourse about the giant's counsel,<br />
and whether yet they had best take it or no. Now Christian<br />
again seemed for doing it, but Hopeful reminded          <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
him of the hardships and terrors he had already gone<br />
through, and said that they ought to bear up with patience<br />
as well as they could, and steadily reject the giant's<br />
wicked counsel.<br />
</p><p>
Now, night being come again, and the giant and his       <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
wife being in bed, she asked him concerning the prisoners,<br />
and if they had taken his counsel. To this he replied,<br />
"They are sturdy rogues; they choose rather to bear all<br />
hardships than to make away with themselves."<br />
</p><p>
Then said she, "Take them into the castle yard to-morrow,<span class="linenum">25</span><br />
and show them the bones and skulls of those that<br />
thou hast already dispatched, and make them believe thou<br />
wilt tear them in pieces, as thou hast done their fellows<br />
before them."<br />
</p><p>
So when morning has come, the giant goes to them again,  <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
and takes them into the castle yard, and shows them as his<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>wife had bidden him. "These," said he, "were pilgrims,<br />
as you are, once, and they trespassed on my grounds,<br />
as you have done; and when I thought fit, I tore them in<br />
pieces; and so within ten days I will do to you. Get<br />
you down to your den again."<br />
</p><p>
And with that he beat them all the way thither.           <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
</p><p>
Now, when night was come, Mrs. Diffidence and her<br />
husband began to renew their discourse of their prisoners.<br />
The old giant wondered that he could neither by his blows<br />
nor by his counsel bring them to an end.<br />
</p><p>
And with that his wife replied. "I fear," said she, "that<span class="linenum">10</span><br />
they live in hopes that some will come to relieve them,<br />
or that they have picklocks about them, by the means of<br />
which they hope to escape."<br />
</p><p>
"And sayest thou so, my dear?" said the giant. "I<br />
will therefore search them in the morning."              <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
</p><p>
Well, on Saturday, about midnight, they began to pray,<br />
and continued in prayer till almost break of day.<br />
</p><p>
Now a little before it was day, good Christian, as one<br />
half amazed, broke out into a passionate speech: "What<br />
a fool am I, thus to lie in a dungeon! I have a key in   <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
my bosom, called Promise, that will, I am persuaded,<br />
open any lock in Doubting Castle."<br />
</p><p>
Then said Hopeful, "That's good news, good brother;<br />
pluck it out of thy bosom and try."<br />
</p><p>
Then Christian pulled it out of his bosom and began      <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
to try at the dungeon door, whose bolt, as he turned the<br />
key, gave back, and the door flew open with ease, and<br />
Christian and Hopeful both came out.<br />
</p><p>
After that, he went to the iron gate, for that must be<br />
opened too, but that lock went desperately hard: yet the <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
key did open it. Then they thrust open the gate to make<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>their escape with speed; but that gate, as it opened, made<br />
such a creaking that it waked Giant Despair, who, hastily<br />
rising to pursue his prisoners, felt his limbs to fail, for his<br />
fits took him again, so that he could by no means go after<br />
them. Then they went on, and came to the King's highway<br />
again, and so were safe.                                  <span class="linenum">5</span><br />

<h2>CHRISTMAS EVE AT FEZZIWIG'S</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Charles Dickens</span></h3>


<p>
Old Fezziwig in his warehouse laid down his pen<br />
and looked up at the clock, which pointed to the<br />
hour of seven. He rubbed his hands; adjusted his waistcoat;<br />
laughed all over himself, from his shoes to his organ     <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
of benevolence; and called out in a comfortable, oily, rich,<br />
fat, jovial voice:<br />
</p><p>
"Yo-ho, there! Ebenezer! Dick!"<br />
</p><p>
Ebenezer came briskly in, followed by his fellow<br />
'prentice.                                               <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
</p><p>
"Yo-ho, my boys!" said Fezziwig. "No more work<br />
to-night. Christmas Eve, Dick! Christmas, Ebenezer!<br />
Let's have the shutters up," cried old Fezziwig, with a<br />
sharp clap of his hands, "before a man can say Jack<br />
Robinson."                                               <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
</p><p>
You wouldn't believe how those two fellows went at it!<br />
They charged into the street with the shutters&mdash;one, two,<br />
three&mdash;had 'em in their places&mdash;four, five, six&mdash;barred<br />
'em and pinned 'em&mdash;seven, eight, nine&mdash;and came back<br />
before you could have got to twelve, panting like race   <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
horses.<br />
</p><p>
"Hilli-ho!" cried old Fezziwig, skipping down from his<br />
desk with wonderful agility. "Clear away, my lads, and<br />
let's have lots of room here! Hilli-ho, Dick! Chirrup,<br />
Ebenezer!"                                               <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
</p><p>
Clear away? There was nothing they wouldn't have<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>cleared away or couldn't have cleared away, with old<br />
Fezziwig looking on. It was done in a minute. Every<br />
movable was packed off, as if it were dismissed from public<br />
life forevermore. The floor was swept and watered, the<br />
lamps were trimmed, fuel was heaped upon the fire; and<br />
the warehouse was as snug and warm, and dry and bright,   <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
as any ballroom you would desire to see.<br />
</p><p>
In came a fiddler with a music book, and went up to the<br />
lofty desk, and made an orchestra of it. In came Mrs.<br />
Fezziwig, one vast substantial smile. In came the three<br />
Miss Fezziwigs, beaming and lovable. In came the six     <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
young followers whose hearts they broke. In came all<br />
the young men and young women employed in the business.<br />
In came the housemaid with her cousin the baker. In<br />
came the cook with her brother's particular friend the milkman<br />
In came the boy from over the way, who was               <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
suspected of not having enough to eat from his master. In<br />
they all came, one after another&mdash;some shyly, some boldly,<br />
some gracefully, some awkwardly, some pushing, some<br />
pulling. In they all came, anyhow and everyhow.<br />
</p><p>
Away they all went, twenty couples at once; down the     <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
middle and up again; round and round in various stages<br />
of affectionate grouping; old top couple always turning up<br />
in the wrong place; new top couple starting off again as<br />
soon as they got there; all top couples at last, and not a<br />
bottom one to help them!                                 <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
</p><p>
When this result was brought about, old Fezziwig,<br />
clapping his hands to stop the dance, cried out, "Well<br />
done!" Then there were more dances, and there were<br />
forfeits, and more dances; and there was cake, and there<br />
was a great piece of cold roast, and there was a great piece         <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
of cold boiled, and there were mince pies and other delicacies.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>But the great effect of the evening came after<br />
the roast and the boiled, when the fiddler, artful dog, struck<br />
up <i>Sir Roger de Coverley</i>. Then old Mr. Fezziwig stood<br />
out to dance with Mrs. Fezziwig. Top couple, too, with<br />
a good stiff piece of work cut out for them; three or<br />
four and twenty pair of partners; people who were not to  <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
be trifled with&mdash;people who would dance and had no<br />
notion of walking.<br />
</p><p>
But if they had been twice as many&mdash;aye, four times&mdash;old<br />
Mr. Fezziwig would have been a match for them and<br />
so would Mrs. Fezziwig. As to <i>her</i>, she was worthy to          <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
be his partner in every sense of the term. If that's not<br />
high praise, tell me higher and I'll use it. . . . And when<br />
Mr. Fezziwig and Mrs. Fezziwig had gone all through the<br />
dance&mdash;advance and retire, both hands to your partner,<br />
bow and curtsy, thread the needle, and back to your place&mdash;Fezziwig   <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
"cut" so deftly that he appeared to wink with<br />
his legs, and came upon his feet again without a stagger.<br />
</p><p>
When the clock struck eleven this domestic ball broke up.<br />
Mr. and Mrs. Fezziwig took their stations one on either<br />
side of the door, and shaking hands with every person    <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
individually as he or she went out, wished him or her a<br />
Merry Christmas. When everybody had retired but the<br />
two apprentices they did the same to them; and thus the<br />
cheerful voices died away and the lads were left to their<br />
beds&mdash;which were under a counter in the back shop.       <span class="linenum">25</span><br />

<h2>JEAN VALJEAN MEETS THE BISHOP</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Victor Hugo</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Victor Hugo (1802-1885), poet, dramatist, and
novelist, dominated the literature of France during
the nineteenth century. His novel, <i>Les
Mis&eacute;rables</i>, written in 1862, during Hugo's long
political exile, exemplifies his extensive
knowledge of the deplorable conditions of life in
France at that time, his understanding of the human
heart, and his marvelous literary ability.</p>

<p>In the following extract from <i>Les Mis&eacute;rables</i>, the
most famous character of the book, Jean Valjean, an
ex-convict, takes his first step toward final
regeneration by meeting Bishop D. The Bishop, known
also as Monseigneur Welcome, voluntarily lived a
simple and austere life with his sister and old
housekeeper, but had humored his one weakness by
retaining his table silver and handsome silver
candlesticks.</p>

<p>Valjean is speaking to the Bishop at the beginning
of the extract.</p></div>


<p>
"You! Listen! I am Jean Valjean, the galley slave.<br />
I was nineteen years in prison. Four days ago<br />
they let me out and I started for Pontarlier. I have been<br />
tramping for four days since I left Toulon, and to-day I<br />
walked twelve leagues. When I came into the town this     <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
evening I went to the inn, but because of my yellow passport<br />
that I had shown at the police office, they drove me<br />
out. Then I went to the other inn and the landlord said<br />
to me, 'Off with you!' Everywhere it was the same;<br />
no one would have anything to do with me. Even the       <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
jailer of the prison would not take me in. So I was lying<br />
on a stone in the square, when a good woman came along<br />
and she said to me, pointing to this place, 'Knock there.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>They will take you in.' What is this? Is it an inn? I<br />
have money&mdash;all that I earned in the prison for nineteen<br />
years&mdash;109 francs and 15 sous. I will pay. I am terribly<br />
tired and almost famished. Will you let me stay here?"<br />
</p><p>
"Madame Magloire," said the Bishop to his aged housekeeper,<br />
"you will please lay another place for supper."           <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
</p><p>
Jean Valjean shuffled to the table where the lamp stood.<br />
He took a large yellow paper from his pocket and unfolded<br />
it. "Wait," he said, "You don't seem to understand. I<br />
am a galley slave, a convict, just from prison. This is<br />
my yellow passport which makes everyone drive me away.   <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
You must read it. I can read it myself; I learned to<br />
read in the prison, where they have a class for those that<br />
want to learn. This is what it says on my yellow paper:<br />
'Jean Valjean, a liberated convict, has been nineteen years<br />
at the galleys. Five years for burglary, fourteen years  <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
for having tried four times to escape. A very dangerous<br />
man.' Now, will you turn me away like all the others,<br />
or will you give me food and a bed? Perhaps you have<br />
a stable?"<br />
</p><p>
"Madame Magloire," said the Bishop, "kindly put clean    <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
sheets on our extra bed in the alcove."<br />
</p><p>
Madame Magloire left the room at once to carry out<br />
these instructions. The Bishop turned to the ex-convict,<br />
saying, "Draw a chair to the fire, sir, we shall eat presently.<br />
Your bed will be prepared while we are at supper."       <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>
After bidding good-night to his sister and Madame Magloire,<br />
the Bishop took one of the silver candlesticks and<br />
handing the other to his guest, Jean Valjean, he said, "I<br />
will conduct you to your room, sir. I trust you will have<br />
a good night's rest. To-morrow morning, before you leave,<span class="linenum">30</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>you will drink a glass of milk from our cow."<br />
</p><p>
As the cathedral bell struck two, Jean Valjean awoke.<br />
The strange sensation of sleeping in a comfortable bed once<br />
more, after nineteen years of life in the galleys, disturbed<br />
his sleep. His first weariness had worn off after a few<br />
hours of deep sleep. After looking into the darkness      <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
about him, he tried to sleep again. When many agitating<br />
sensations have filled a man's day, and still preoccupy his<br />
mind, he may fall asleep once, but he cannot go to sleep a<br />
second time. So sleep had come to Jean Valjean, but would<br />
not return to him, and he lay awake thinking.            <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
</p><p>
His mind was filled with troubled ideas, which seemed<br />
to float in a kind of obscurity. His old recollections and<br />
recent experiences became confused, lost their identity,<br />
grew out of proportion, dwindled, then disappeared entirely,<br />
all in a distressing vagueness. But one thought persistently         <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
returned, to the exclusion of all the others. It was this:<br />
the six silver forks and spoons and the handsome silver<br />
ladle were in the next room, only a few yards from him. He<br />
had seen Madame Magloire put them into a small cupboard<br />
in the adjoining room, on the right as you came from     <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
the dining room. It was fine, old silver&mdash;the ladle alone<br />
must be worth at least 200 francs, which was twice as<br />
much as he had earned during his nineteen years in the<br />
galleys.<br />
</p><p>
For one hour his mind was occupied with this absorbing   <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
theme&mdash;weighing, wavering, even struggling. Suddenly<br />
at the stroke of three, he sat upright, reached out for his<br />
knapsack, which he had thrown into a corner, and found<br />
himself, to his surprise, seated on the edge of the bed. He<br />
sat thus for a while, deep in thought; then stooped, took<span class="linenum">30</span><br />
off his shoes; then once more resumed his thoughts, sitting<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>motionless. During this period, he again had the sensation<br />
of all his old and new experiences crossing and recrossing<br />
each other in his mind and weighing upon him. He was<br />
thinking of an old companion of the galleys, recalling his<br />
queer mannerisms, when the clock struck the quarter or<br />
half hour, seeming to call to him "To work!"              <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
</p><p>
He stood up and listened. The house was absolutely<br />
silent. He tiptoed to the window and looked out. The<br />
wind was driving heavy clouds across a full moon, producing<br />
alternate light and darkness, within and without. Jean<br />
Valjean examined the window; it was closed by a small peg,           <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
had no bars, and looked upon the little garden. He opened<br />
it, but closed it again promptly upon the sharp cold wind<br />
that entered. A study of the garden showed it to be inclosed<br />
by a low whitewashed wall, and a view of treetops<br />
at regular intervals beyond indicated a public walk.     <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
</p><p>
This study being completed, Jean Valjean returned to<br />
the alcove, drew from his knapsack an iron bar which he<br />
placed on the bed, put his shoes in a compartment of his<br />
knapsack, which he then lifted to his shoulders, drew his<br />
cap down over his eyes, took his stick from the corner, and          <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
finally returning to the bed, took up the article which he<br />
had laid there.<br />
</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>
At sunrise the following morning, the Bishop was walking<br />
as usual in his little garden, when Madame Magloire<br />
came hurrying toward him in the greatest excitement.     <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
</p><p>
"Monseigneur," she exclaimed, "all our table silver is<br />
stolen and the man is gone."<br />
</p><p>
Just then, glancing at the corner of the garden, she saw<br />
that the coping of the wall had been broken away.<br />
</p><p>
"Look at the wall! He must have climbed over into the    <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>lane! And all our silver stolen! What a crime!"<br />
</p><p>
After a moment's silence, the Bishop said earnestly to<br />
Madame Magloire,<br />
</p><p>
"As a matter of fact, was the silver really ours?"<br />
</p><p>
The old housekeeper stood speechless. The Bishop<br />
continued,                                                <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
</p><p>
"It was wrong of me to keep that silver; it belonged<br />
rightfully to the poor. And that man was a poor man,<br />
surely."<br />
</p><p>
"Oh, Monseigneur!" murmured Madame Magloire,<br />
"neither Mademoiselle your sister, nor I, care about the <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
silver. It was only for you. What will Monseigneur eat<br />
with now?"<br />
</p><p>
"Are not pewter forks and spoons to be had?" said the<br />
Bishop.<br />
</p><p>
"Pewter smells," said Madame Magloire.                   <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
</p><p>
"Then iron?" continued the Bishop.<br />
</p><p>
"Iron has a bad taste," and Madame Magloire grimaced<br />
expressively.<br />
</p><p>
"That still leaves wood," exclaimed the Bishop triumphantly.<br />
Later, at breakfast, the Bishop jokingly commented       <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
to his silent sister and grumbling housekeeper, that<br />
for a breakfast of bread and milk even a wooden fork was<br />
unnecessary.<br />
</p><p>
"Just think of it," muttered Madame Magloire as she<br />
trotted back and forth between the dining room and kitchen,          <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
"to take in a convict like that, and let him eat and sleep<br />
with decent people. It's lucky that he didn't do worse<br />
than steal. It terrifies one just to think of what might have<br />
happened."<br />
</p><p>
At the moment that the Bishop and his sister were        <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
leaving the table, there was a knock at the door.<br />
</p><p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>"Enter," said the Bishop.<br />
</p><p>
The door opened, and there appeared three gendarmes<br />
holding a man by the collar. The man was Jean Valjean.<br />
The leader of the party, a corporal, saluted the Bishop.<br />
</p><p>
"Monseigneur," he began.<br />
</p><p>
Jean Valjean looked up, dazed.                            <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
</p><p>
"Monseigneur!" he muttered, "then this is not an inn.<br />
He is not just a priest!"<br />
</p><p>
"Silence," commanded the corporal. "This is Monseigneur<br />
the Bishop."<br />
</p><p>
The aged Bishop was making his way to Jean Valjean as    <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
rapidly as he could.<br />
</p><p>
"Ah, here you are again," he said, "I am glad to see<br />
you. You know I gave you the candlesticks, too. Why<br />
did you not take them? They are worth at least 200<br />
francs. You should have taken them along with the plate  <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
silver."<br />
</p><p>
Words cannot describe the expression in the eyes of Jean<br />
Valjean as he gazed at the Bishop.<br />
</p><p>
"Then, Monseigneur, what this man says is true?" asked<br />
the corporal. "He looked as if he was escaping from somewhere,       <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
so we arrested him. And then we found this silver<br />
plate upon him."<br />
</p><p>
"And then," interrupted the Bishop, "he explained, of<br />
course, that an old priest at whose house he stayed last<br />
night gave him the plate? I see. And you brought him     <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
back. You were wrong."<br />
</p><p>
"Then we are to let him go?" asked the corporal.<br />
</p><p>
"Certainly," replied the Bishop.<br />
</p><p>
Jean Valjean was released. He staggered back.<br />
</p><p>
"Is it true that I am free?" he murmured weakly.         <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
</p><p>
"Yes, of course. And my friend," the Bishop continued,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>"take the candlesticks with you this time."<br />
</p><p>
Going to the mantelpiece, he took down the two candlesticks<br />
and brought them to Jean Valjean. The two<br />
women watched, speechless, but made no sign of dissent.<br />
Jean Valjean was trembling; he took the candlesticks<br />
mechanically, as if in a dream.                           <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
</p><p>
"Depart in peace," said the Bishop, "and, by the way,<br />
when you come again, enter by the front door; it is only<br />
latched."<br />
</p><p>
Turning to the gendarmes, he said, "Gentlemen, it is<br />
unnecessary for you to remain."                          <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
</p><p>
The gendarmes retired.<br />
</p><p>
Jean Valjean seemed unable to recover his senses; he<br />
felt himself about to faint, when the Bishop approached<br />
and said to him, in a very low voice,<br />
</p><p>
"Remember always, my friend, that I have your promise    <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
to use this money to become an honest man."<br />
</p><p>
Jean Valjean, unconscious of having made a promise of<br />
any kind, remained silent.<br />
</p><p>
With great solemnity, the Bishop continued, in a low<br />
but firm voice:                                          <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
</p><p>
"Jean Valjean, henceforth you belong only to good.<br />
Your soul I have bought and herewith I banish from it all<br />
black thoughts and the spirit of Evil, and give it to Good."<br />

<h2>A VOYAGE TO LILLIPUT</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Jonathan Swift</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The adventures of Captain Lemuel Gulliver, as told
by Swift in <i>Gulliver's Travels</i>, have been read
with delight for two hundred years. Gulliver first
lands in Lilliput and has thrilling adventures
among the little people. Then he visits
Brobdingnag, the land of giants. His third voyage
takes him to Laputa, where he sees the
philosophers; and on the fourth he visits the land
of the Houyhnhnms. The last two voyages are not so
entertaining as the first two, which are classics.</p></div>


<p>
We set sail from Bristol May 4th, 1699, and our voyage<br />
at first was very prosperous. It would not be<br />
proper, for some reasons, to trouble the reader with the<br />
particulars of our adventures in those seas; let it suffice to<br />
inform him that in our passage from thence to the East    <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
Indies we were driven by a violent storm to the northwest<br />
of Van Diemen's Land. By an observation we found ourselves<br />
in the latitude of thirty degrees, two minutes, south.<br />
Twelve of our crew were dead by immoderate labor and ill<br />
food, and the rest were in a very weak condition.        <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
</p><p>
On the fifth of November, which was the beginning of<br />
summer in those parts, the weather being very hazy, the<br />
seamen spied a rock within half a cable's length of the ship;<br />
but the wind was so strong that we were driven directly<br />
upon it and immediately split. Six of the crew, of whom  <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
I was one, having let down the boat into the sea, made a<br />
shift to get clear of the ship and the rock. We rowed, by<br />
my computation, about three leagues, till we were able to<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>work no longer, being already spent with labor while we<br />
were in the ship. We therefore trusted ourselves to the<br />
mercy of the waves, and in about half an hour the boat<br />
was overset by a sudden flurry from the north. What<br />
became of my companions in the boat, as well as those<br />
who escaped on the rock or were left in the vessel, I cannot          <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
tell; but conclude they were all lost.<br />
</p><p>
For my own part I swam as fortune directed me, and was<br />
pushed forward by wind and tide. I often let my legs<br />
drop, and could feel no bottom; but when I was almost<br />
gone, and able to struggle no longer, I found myself within          <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
my depth, and by this time the storm was much abated.<br />
The declivity was so small that I walked near a mile before<br />
I got to the shore, which I reached, as I conjectured, at about<br />
eight o'clock in the evening. I then advanced forward near<br />
half a mile, but could not discover any sign of houses or<span class="linenum">15</span><br />
inhabitants; at least I was in so weak a condition that I<br />
did not observe them. I was extremely tired, and with<br />
that, and the heat of the weather, and about half a pint<br />
of brandy that I drank as I left the ship, I found myself<br />
much inclined to sleep. I lay down on the grass, which was           <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
very short and soft, where I slept sounder than ever I<br />
remember to have done in my life, and, as I reckoned, above<br />
nine hours; for when I awaked it was just daylight. I<br />
attempted to rise, but was not able to stir; for as I happened<br />
to lie on my back, I found my arms and legs were strongly<span class="linenum">25</span><br />
fastened on each side to the ground; and my hair, which<br />
was long and thick, tied down in the same manner. I likewise<br />
felt several slender ligatures across my body, from my<br />
armpits to my thighs. I could only look upwards, the<br />
sun began to grow hot, and the light offended my eyes.   <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
I heard a confused noise about me, but in the posture in<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>which I lay, I could see nothing except the sky.<br />
</p><p>
In a little time I felt something alive moving on my<br />
left leg, which advancing gently forward over my breast,<br />
came almost up to my chin, when bending mine eyes downward<br />
as much as I could I perceived it to be a human creature<br />
not six inches high, with a bow and arrow in his          <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
hands, and a quiver at his back. In the meantime I<br />
felt at least forty more of the same kind (as I conjectured)<br />
following the first. I was in the utmost astonishment, and<br />
roared so loud that they all ran back in a fright; and some<br />
of them, as I was afterwards told, were hurt with the falls          <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
they got by leaping from my sides upon the ground. However<br />
they soon returned, and one of them, who ventured<br />
so far as to get a full sight of my face, lifting up his hands<br />
and eyes by way of admiration, cried out in a shrill but<br />
distinct voice, "<i>Hekinah degul</i>"; and others repeated the      <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
same words several times, but I then knew not what they<br />
meant. I lay all this while, as the reader may believe, in<br />
great uneasiness.<br />
</p><p>
At length, struggling to get loose, I had the fortune to<br />
break the strings and wrench out the pegs that fastened  <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
my left arm to the ground; for, by lifting it up to my face,<br />
I discovered the methods they had taken to bind me; and,<br />
at the same time, with a violent pull which gave me<br />
excessive pain, I a little loosened the strings that tied down<br />
my hair on the left side, so that I was just able to turn my         <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
head about two inches; but the creatures ran off a second<br />
time, before I could seize them, whereupon there was a<br />
great shout in a very shrill accent, and after it ceased I<br />
heard one of them cry aloud, "<i>Tolgo phonac</i>," when in an<br />
instant I felt above a hundred arrows discharged on my   <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
left hand, which pricked me like so many needles; and,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>besides, they shot another flight into the air, as we do bombs<br />
in Europe, whereof many, I suppose, fell on my body<br />
(though I felt them not) and some on my face, which I<br />
immediately covered with my left hand. When this shower<br />
was over, I fell a groaning with grief and pain; and then<br />
striving again to get loose, they discharged another volley           <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
larger than the first, and some of them attempted with<br />
spears to stick me in the sides; but, by good luck, I had<br />
on me a buff jerkin, which they could not pierce.<br />
</p><p>
I thought it the most prudent method to lie still, and<br />
my design was to continue so till night, when my left hand           <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
being already loose I could easily free myself. And as for<br />
the inhabitants, I had reason to believe I might be a match<br />
for the greatest armies they could bring against me, if<br />
they were all of the same size with him that I saw. But<br />
fortune disposed otherwise of me. When the people        <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
observed I was quiet, they discharged no more arrows;<br />
but by the noise I heard I knew their numbers increased;<br />
and about four yards from me, over against my right ear,<br />
I heard a knocking for above an hour, like that of people at<br />
work; when, turning my head that way as well as the pegs <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
and strings would permit me, I saw a stage erected about a<br />
foot and a half from the ground, capable of holding four<br />
of the inhabitants, with two or three ladders to mount it,<br />
from whence one of them, who seemed to be a person of<br />
quality, made me a long speech, whereof I understood not <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
one syllable. But I should have mentioned that before<br />
the principal person began his oration he cried out three<br />
times, "<i>Langro dehlsan</i>" (these words and the former were<br />
afterwards repeated and explained to me), whereupon immediately<br />
about fifty of the inhabitants came and cut the          <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
strings that fastened the left side of my head, which gave<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>me the liberty of turning it to the right and of observing<br />
the person and gesture of him that was to speak. He<br />
appeared to be of a middle age, and taller than any of<br />
the other three who attended him, whereof one was a<br />
page that held up his train, and seemed to be somewhat<br />
longer than my middle finger; the other two stood one     <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
on each side to support him. He acted every part of an<br />
orator, and I could observe many periods of threatenings,<br />
and others of promises, pity, and kindness. I answered<br />
in a few words, but in the most submissive manner, lifting<br />
up my left hand and both mine eyes to the sun, as        <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
calling him for a witness: and being almost famished<br />
with hunger, having not eaten a morsel for some hours before<br />
I left the ship, I found the demands of nature so<br />
strong upon me that I could not forbear showing my<br />
impatience (perhaps against the strict rules of decency) <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
by putting my finger frequently on my mouth, to signify<br />
that I wanted food. The <i>hurgo</i> (for so they call a<br />
great lord, as I afterwards learned) understood me very<br />
well.<br />
</p><p>
He descended from the stage, and commanded that          <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
several ladders should be applied to my side on which above<br />
a hundred of the inhabitants mounted, and walked toward<br />
my mouth, laden with baskets full of meat, which had been<br />
provided and sent thither by the king's orders upon the<br />
first intelligence he received of me. I observed there was           <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
the flesh of several animals, but could not distinguish<br />
them by the taste. There were shoulders, legs, and loins,<br />
shaped like those of mutton, and very well dressed, but<br />
smaller than the wings of a lark. I ate them by two or<br />
three at a mouthful, and took three loaves at a time about           <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
the bigness of musket bullets. They supplied me as fast<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>as they could, showing a thousand marks of wonder and<br />
astonishment at my bulk and appetite. I then made another<br />
sign that I wanted drink. They found by my eating<br />
that a small quantity would not suffice me, and, being a most<br />
ingenious people, they flung up with great dexterity one of<br />
their largest hogsheads; then rolled it toward my hand,   <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
and beat out the top; I drank it off at a draft, which I<br />
might well do, for it did not hold half a pint and tasted<br />
like a small wine of Burgundy, but much more delicious.<br />
They brought me a second hogshead, which I drank in the<br />
same manner and made signs for more, but they had none   <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
to give me. When I had performed these wonders they<br />
shouted for joy, and danced upon my breast, repeating<br />
several times, as they did at first, "<i>Hekinah degul</i>."<br />
They made me a sign that I should throw down the two<br />
hogsheads, but first warning the people below to stand out           <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
of the way, crying aloud, "<i>Borach mivola</i>"; and when they<br />
saw the vessels in the air, there was an universal shout of<br />
"<i>Hekinah degul</i>." I confess I was often tempted, while<br />
they were passing backward and forward on my body, to<br />
seize forty or fifty of the first that came in my reach, and         <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
dash them against the ground. But the remembrance of<br />
what I had felt, which probably might not be the worst<br />
they could do, and the promise of honor I made them, for<br />
so I interpreted my submissive behavior, soon drove out<br />
these imaginations. Besides, I now considered myself as  <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
bound by the laws of hospitality to a people who had treated<br />
me with so much expense and magnificence. However,<br />
in my thoughts I could not sufficiently wonder at the intrepidity<br />
of these diminutive mortals, who durst venture to<br />
mount and walk upon my body, while one of my hands was   <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
at liberty, without trembling at the very sight of so prodigious<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>a creature as I must appear to them.<br />
</p><p>
After some time, when they observed that I made no more<br />
demand for meat, there appeared before me a person of<br />
high rank from His Imperial Majesty. His Excellency having<br />
mounted on the small of my right leg, advanced forward,<br />
up to my face, with about a dozen of his retinue, and     <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
producing his credentials under the signet royal, which he<br />
applied close to mine eyes, spoke about ten minutes,<br />
without any signs of anger, but with a kind of determinate<br />
resolution, often pointing forward, which, as I afterward<br />
found, was toward the capital city, about half a mile distant,       <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
whither it was agreed by His Majesty in council that<br />
I must be conveyed. I answered in a few words, but to<br />
no purpose, and made a sign with my hand that was loose,<br />
putting it to the other (but over His Excellency's head<br />
for fear of hurting him or his train) and then to my own head        <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
and body, to signify that I desired my liberty. It appeared<br />
that he understood me well enough, for he shook his head by<br />
way of disapprobation, and held his hand in a posture to show<br />
that I must be carried as a prisoner. However, he made<br />
other signs to let me understand that I should have meat and         <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
drink enough, and very good treatment: whereupon I<br />
once more thought of attempting to break my bonds, but<br />
again, when I felt the smart of their arrows upon my face<br />
and hands, which were all in blisters, and many of the darts<br />
still sticking in them, and observing likewise that the  <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
number of my enemies increased, I gave tokens to let them<br />
know that they might do with me what they pleased. Upon<br />
this the <i>hurgo</i> and his train withdrew with much civility<br />
and cheerful countenances.<br />
</p><p>
Soon after I heard a general shout, with frequent repetition         <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
of the words "<i>Peplom selan</i>," and I felt great<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>numbers of the people on my left side relaxing the cords to<br />
such a degree that I was able to turn upon my right. But<br />
before this they had daubed my face and both my hands<br />
with a sort of ointment very pleasant to the smell, which in<br />
a few minutes removed all the smart of their arrows.<br />
These circumstances, added to the refreshment I had       <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
received by their victuals and drink, which were very<br />
nourishing, disposed me to sleep. I slept about eight hours<br />
as I was afterward assured; and it was no wonder, for the<br />
physicians, by the emperor's order, had mingled a sleeping<br />
potion in the hogsheads of wine.                         <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
</p><p>
It seems that upon the first moment I was discovered<br />
sleeping on the ground after my landing, the emperor<br />
had early notice of it by an express, and determined in<br />
council that I should be tied in the manner I have related<br />
(which was done in the night while I slept), that plenty of          <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
meat and drink should be sent to me, and a machine<br />
prepared to carry me to the capital city.<br />
</p><p>
This resolution perhaps may appear very bold and<br />
dangerous, and I am confident would not be imitated by<br />
any prince in Europe on the like occasion; however, in   <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
my opinion it was extremely prudent as well as generous.<br />
For supposing these people had endeavored to kill me with<br />
their spears and arrows while I was asleep, I should certainly<br />
have awaked with the first sense of smart, which<br />
might so far have roused my rage and strength as to have <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
enabled me to break the strings wherewith I was tied;<br />
after which, as they were not able to make resistance,<br />
so they could expect no mercy.<br />
</p><p>
These people are most excellent mathematicians, and<br />
arrived to a great perfection in mechanics by the countenance        <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
and encouragement of the emperor, who is a renowned<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>patron of learning. This prince hath several<br />
machines fixed on wheels for the carriage of trees and other<br />
great weights. He often builds his largest men of war,<br />
whereof some are nine feet long, in the woods where the<br />
timber grows, and has them carried on these engines three<br />
or four hundred yards to the sea. Five hundred carpenters <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
and engineers were immediately set at work to prepare the<br />
greatest engine they had. It was a frame of wood raised<br />
three inches from the ground, about seven feet long and<br />
four wide, moving upon twenty-two wheels. The shout<br />
I heard was upon the arrival of this engine, which it seems           <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
set out in four hours after my landing. It was brought<br />
parallel to me as I lay. But the principal difficulty was to<br />
raise and place me in this vehicle. Eighty poles, each of<br />
one foot high, were erected for this purpose, and very strong<br />
cords of the bigness of packthread were fastened by hooks<span class="linenum">15</span><br />
to many bandages, which the workmen had girt round my<br />
neck, my hands, my body, and my legs. Nine hundred of<br />
the strongest men were employed to draw up these cords<br />
by many pulleys fastened on the poles, and thus in less<br />
than three hours, I was raised and flung into the engine,<span class="linenum">20</span><br />
and there tied fast. All this I was told, for while the whole<br />
operation was performing, I lay in a profound sleep, by<br />
the force of that soporiferous medicine infused into my<br />
liquor. Fifteen hundred of the emperor's largest horses,<br />
each about four inches and a half high, were employed to <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
draw me toward the metropolis, which, as I said, was<br />
half a mile distant.<br />
</p><p>
About four hours after we began our journey, I awaked<br />
by a very ridiculous accident; for the carriage being stopped<br />
a while to adjust something that was out of order, two or<span class="linenum">30</span><br />
three of the young natives had the curiosity to see how I<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>looked when I was asleep; they climbed up into the engine,<br />
and advancing very softly to my face, one of them, an<br />
officer in the guards, put the sharp end of his half-pike<br />
a good way into my left nostril, which tickled my nose like<br />
a straw, and made me sneeze violently; whereupon they<br />
stole off unperceived, and it was three weeks before I knew           <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
the cause of my awaking so suddenly. We made a long<br />
march the remaining part of that day, and rested that<br />
night with five hundred guards on each side of me, half<br />
with torches, and half with bows and arrows, ready to<br />
shoot me if I should offer to stir. The next morning at  <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
sunrise we continued our march, and arrived within two<br />
hundred yards of the city gates about noon. The emperor<br />
and all his court came out to meet us, but his great<br />
officers would by no means suffer His Majesty to endanger<br />
his person by mounting on my body.                       <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
</p><p>
At the place where the carriage stopped, there stood an<br />
ancient temple, esteemed to be the largest in the whole<br />
kingdom, which having been polluted some years before by<br />
an unnatural murder, was, according to the zeal of those<br />
people, looked on as profane, and therefore had been applied         <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
to common use, and all the ornaments and furniture carried<br />
away. In this edifice it was determined I should lodge.<br />
The great gate fronting to the north was about four feet<br />
high, and almost two feet wide, through which I could easily<br />
creep. On each side of the gate was a small window, not  <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
above six inches from the ground; into that on the left side<br />
the king's smiths conveyed fourscore and eleven chains,<br />
like those that hang to a lady's watch in Europe, and almost<br />
as large, which were locked to my left leg with six and<br />
thirty padlocks. Over against this temple, on the other side         <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
of the great highway, at twenty foot distance, there was a<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>turret at least five foot high. Here the emperor ascended<br />
with at least twenty lords of his court, to have an opportunity<br />
of viewing me, as I was told, for I could not see<br />
them. It was reckoned that above an hundred thousand<br />
inhabitants came out of the town upon the same errand;<br />
and in spite of my guards, I believe there could not be fewer         <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
than ten thousand, at several times, who mounted upon my<br />
body by the help of ladders. But a proclamation was soon<br />
issued to forbid it upon pain of death. When the workmen<br />
found that it was impossible for me to break loose, they<br />
cut all the strings that bound me; whereupon I rose up   <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
with as melancholy a disposition as ever I had in my life.<br />
But the noise and astonishment of the people at seeing me<br />
rise and walk are not to be expressed. The chains that<br />
held my left leg were about two yards long, and gave me<br />
not only the liberty of walking backwards and forwards in<span class="linenum">15</span><br />
a semicircle, but being fixed within four inches of the gate,<br />
allowed me to creep in, and lie at full length in the temple.<br />

<h2><a name="THE_STRUGGLE_IN_THE_ARENA" id="THE_STRUGGLE_IN_THE_ARENA"></a>THE STRUGGLE IN THE ARENA</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Henryk Sienkiewicz</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Nero was the emperor of Rome, A. D. 54-68. He was a
wicked tyrant among whose crimes are the death of
his first wife, the death of his own mother, and
the murder of a second wife. Two thirds of the city
of Rome was burned, and the emperor has been
accused of having had the fire set so he could
enjoy the sight. Be that as it may, Nero laid the
blame on the Christians whom he persecuted. They
were thrown into prison, fed to wild beasts in the
arena, and burned on poles. Among the captives were
the maid Lygia, and her faithful guard, Ursus.
Vinicius, Lygia's lover, belonged to the Roman
nobility. He had once tried to seize Lygia, but
Ursus had foiled his plan by killing the attendant,
Croton.</p></div>


<p>
The prefect of the city waved a red handkerchief, the<br />
hinges opposite C&aelig;sar's podium creaked, and out of<br />
the dark gully came Ursus into the brightly lighted arena.<br />
</p><p>
The giant blinked, dazed evidently by the glitter of the<br />
arena; then he pushed into the center, gazing around as   <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
if to see what he had to meet. It was known to all the<br />
Augustans and to most of the spectators that he was the<br />
man who had stifled Croton; hence at sight of him a<br />
murmur passed along every bench. In Rome there was<br />
no lack of gladiators larger by far than the common      <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
measure of man, but Roman eyes had never seen the like<br />
of Ursus. Cassius, standing in C&aelig;sar's podium, seemed<br />
puny compared with that Lygian.<br />
</p><p>
Senators, vestals, C&aelig;sar, the Augustans, and the people<br />
gazed with the delight of experts at his mighty limbs as <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>large as tree trunks, at his breast as large as two shields<br />
joined together, and his arms of a Hercules. The murmur<br />
rose every instant. For those multitudes there could be<br />
no higher pleasure than to look at those muscles in play<br />
in the exertion of a struggle. The murmur rose to shouts,<br />
and eager questions were put: Where did the people live   <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
who could produce such a giant?<br />
</p><p>
He stood there, in the middle of the amphitheater, naked,<br />
more like a stone colossus than a man, with a collected<br />
expression, and at the same time the sad look of a barbarian;<br />
and while surveying the empty arena, he gazed            <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
wonderingly with his blue childlike eyes, now at the spectators,<br />
now at C&aelig;sar, now at the grating of the cunicula,<br />
whence, as he thought, his executioners would come.<br />
</p><p>
At that moment when he stepped into the arena his<br />
simple heart was beating for the last time with the hope <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
that perhaps a cross was waiting for him; but when he<br />
saw neither the cross nor the hole in which it might be put,<br />
he thought that he was unworthy of such favor&mdash;that he<br />
would find death in another way, and surely from wild<br />
beasts. He was unarmed, and had determined to die as     <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
became a confessor of the "Lamb," peacefully and patiently.<br />
Meanwhile he wished to pray once more to the<br />
Savior; so he knelt on the arena, joined his hands, and<br />
raised his eyes toward the stars which were glittering in the<br />
lofty opening of the amphitheater.                       <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
</p><p>
That act displeased the crowds. They had had enough<br />
of those Christians who died like sheep. They understood<br />
that if the giant would not defend himself the spectacle<br />
would be a failure. Here and there hisses were heard.<br />
Some began to cry for scourgers, whose office it was to  <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
lash combatants unwilling to fight. But soon all had<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>grown silent, for no one knew what was waiting for the<br />
giant, nor whether he would not be ready to struggle when<br />
he met death eye to eye.<br />
</p><p>
In fact, they had not long to wait. Suddenly the shrill<br />
sound of brazen trumpets was heard, and at that signal a<br />
grating opposite C&aelig;sar's podium was opened, and into the  <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
arena rushed, amid shouts of beast keepers, an enormous<br />
German aurochs, bearing on his head the naked body of a<br />
woman.<br />
</p><p>
"Lygia! Lygia!" cried Vinicius.<br />
</p><p>
Then he seized his hair near the temples, squirmed like a<span class="linenum">10</span><br />
man who feels a sharp dart in his body, and began to<br />
repeat in hoarse accents:<br />
</p><p>
"I believe! I believe! O Christ, a miracle!"<br />
</p><p>
And he did not even feel that Petronius covered his<br />
head that moment with the toga. It seemed to him that    <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
death or pain had closed his eyes. He did not look, he did<br />
not see. The feeling of some awful emptiness possessed him.<br />
In his head there remained not a thought; his lips merely<br />
repeated, as if in madness,<br />
</p><p>
"I believe! I believe! I believe!"                       <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
</p><p>
This time the amphitheater was silent. The Augustans<br />
rose in their places, as one man, for in the arena something<br />
uncommon had happened. That Lygian, obedient and<br />
ready to die, when he saw his queen on the horns of the<br />
wild beast sprang up as if touched by living fire, and   <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
bending forward he ran at the raging animal.<br />
</p><p>
From all breasts a sudden cry of amazement was heard,<br />
after which came deep silence.<br />
</p><p>
The Lygian fell on the raging bull in a twinkle, and seized<br />
him by the horns.                                        <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
</p><p>
"Look!" cried Petronius, snatching the toga from the<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>head of Vinicius.<br />
</p><p>
The latter rose; his face was as pale as linen, and he looked<br />
into the arena with a glassy, vacant stare.<br />
</p><p>
All breasts ceased to breathe. In the amphitheater a fly<br />
might be heard on the wing. People could not believe their<br />
own eyes. Since Rome was Rome, no one had seen such a     <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
spectacle.<br />
</p><p>
The Lygian held the wild beast by the horns. The man's<br />
feet sank in the sand to his ankles, his back was bent like a<br />
drawn bow, his head was hidden between his shoulders, on<br />
his arms the muscles came out so that the skin almost    <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
burst from their pressure; but he had stopped the bull in<br />
his tracks. And the man and the beast remained so still<br />
that the spectators thought themselves looking at a picture<br />
showing a deed of Hercules or Theseus, or a group hewn<br />
from stone.                                              <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
</p><p>
But in that apparent repose there was a tremendous<br />
exertion of two struggling forces. The bull sank his feet<br />
as well as did the man in the sand, and his dark, shaggy<br />
body was curved so that it seemed a gigantic ball.<br />
Which of the two would fail first, which would fall first,&mdash;that     <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
was the question for those spectators enamored of such<br />
struggles; a question which at that moment meant more<br />
for them than their own fate, than all Rome and its lordship<br />
over the world.<br />
</p><p>
That Lygian was in their eyes then a demigod worthy of   <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
honor and statues. C&aelig;sar himself stood up as well as<br />
others. He and Tigellinus, hearing of the man's strength,<br />
had arranged this spectacle purposely, and said to each<br />
other with a jeer, "Let that slayer of Croton kill the<br />
bull which we choose for him"; so they looked now with   <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
amazement at that picture as if not believing that it<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>could be real.<br />
</p><p>
In the amphitheater were men who had raised their<br />
arms and remained in that posture. Sweat covered the<br />
faces of others, as if they themselves were struggling with<br />
the beast. In the Circus nothing was heard save the<br />
sound of flame in the lamps, and the crackle of bits of coal          <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
as they dropped from the torches. Their voices died on<br />
the lips of the spectators, but their hearts were beating<br />
in their breasts as if to split them. It seemed to all that<br />
the struggle was lasting for ages. But the man and the<br />
beast continued on in their monstrous exertion; one      <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
might have said that they were planted in the earth.<br />
</p><p>
Meanwhile a dull roar resembling a groan was heard from<br />
the arena, after which a brief shout was wrested from every<br />
breast, and again there was silence. People thought<br />
themselves dreaming till the enormous head of the bull   <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
began to turn in the iron hands of the barbarian. The<br />
face, neck, and arms of the Lygian grew purple; his back<br />
bent still more. It was clear that he was rallying the<br />
remnant of his superhuman strength, but that he could<br />
not last long.                                           <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
</p><p>
Duller and duller, hoarser and hoarser, more and more<br />
painful grew the groan of the bull as it mingled with the<br />
whistling breath from the breast of the giant. The head of<br />
the beast turned more and more, and from his jaws came a<br />
long, foaming tongue.                                    <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
</p><p>
A moment more, and to the ears of spectators sitting<br />
nearer came as it were the crack of breaking bones; then the<br />
beast rolled on the earth with his neck twisted in death.<br />
</p><p>
The giant removed in a twinkle the ropes from the horns<br />
of the bull, and, raising the maiden, began to breathe   <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
hurriedly. His face became pale, his hair stuck together<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>from sweat, his shoulders and arms seemed flooded with<br />
water. For a moment he stood as if only half conscious;<br />
then he raised his eyes and looked at the spectators.<br />
</p><p>
The amphitheater had gone wild.<br />
</p><p>
The walls of the building were trembling from the roar of<br />
tens of thousands of people. Since the beginning of spectacles        <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
there was no memory of such excitement. Those<br />
who were sitting on the highest rows came down, crowding<br />
in the passages between benches to look more nearly at the<br />
strong man. Everywhere were heard cries for mercy,<br />
passionate and persistent, which soon turned into one    <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
unbroken thunder. That giant had become dear to those<br />
people enamored of physical strength; he was the first<br />
personage in Rome.<br />
</p><p>
He understood that the multitudes were striving to grant<br />
him his life and restore him his freedom, but clearly his<span class="linenum">15</span><br />
thought was not on himself alone. He looked around<br />
awhile; then approached C&aelig;sar's podium, and holding<br />
the body of the maiden on his outstretched arms, raised his<br />
eyes with entreaty, as if to say,<br />
</p><p>
"Have mercy on her! Save the maiden. I did that for      <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
her sake!"<br />
</p><p>
The spectators understood perfectly what he wanted.<br />
At sight of the unconscious maiden, who near the enormous<br />
Lygian seemed a child, emotion seized the multitude of<br />
senators and knights. Her slender form, as white as if   <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
chiseled from alabaster, her fainting, the dreadful danger<br />
from which the giant had freed her, and finally her beauty<br />
and attachment had moved every heart. Some thought<br />
the man a father begging mercy for his child. Pity burst<br />
forth suddenly, like a flame. They had had blood, death, <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
and torture in sufficiency. Voices choked with tears began<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>to entreat mercy for both.<br />
</p><p>
Meanwhile, Ursus, holding the girl in his arms, moved<br />
around the arena, and with his eyes and with motions begged<br />
her life for her. Now Vinicius started up from his seat,<br />
sprang over the barrier which separated the front places<br />
from the arena, and, running to Lygia, covered her naked  <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
body with his toga.<br />
</p><p>
Then he tore apart the tunic on his breast, laid bare the<br />
scars left by wounds received in the Armenian war, and<br />
stretched out his hands to the audience.<br />
</p><p>
Then the enthusiasm of the multitude passed everything   <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
seen in a circus before. The crowd stamped and howled.<br />
Voices calling for mercy grew simply terrible. People not<br />
only took the part of the athlete, but rose in defense of the<br />
soldier, the maiden, their love. Thousands of spectators<br />
turned to C&aelig;sar with flashes of anger in their eyes and with         <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
clinched fists.<br />
</p><p>
But C&aelig;sar halted and hesitated. Against Vinicius he<br />
had no hatred indeed, and the death of Lygia did not<br />
concern him; but he preferred to see the body of the maiden<br />
rent by the horns of the bull or torn by the claws of beasts.        <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
His cruelty, his deformed imagination and deformed desires,<br />
found a kind of delight in such spectacles. And now the<br />
people wanted to rob him. Hence anger appeared on his<br />
bloated face. Self-love also would not let him yield to the<br />
wish of the multitude, and still he did not dare to oppose           <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
it, through his inborn cowardice.<br />
</p><p>
So he gazed around to see if, among the Augustans at<br />
least, he could not find fingers turned down in sign of death.<br />
But Petronius held up his hand, and looked almost challengingly<br />
into Nero's face. Vestinius, superstitious but           <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
inclined to enthusiasm, a man who feared ghosts but not<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>the living, gave a sign for mercy also.<br />
</p><p>
Then Nero turned to the place where command over the<br />
pretorians was held by the stern Subrius Flavius, hitherto<br />
devoted with whole soul to him, and saw something unusual.<br />
The face of the old tribune was stern, but covered with<br />
tears, and he was holding his hand up in sign of mercy.   <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
</p><p>
Now rage began to possess the multitude. Dust rose<br />
from beneath the stamping feet, and filled the amphitheater.<br />
In the midst of shouts were heard cries: "Ahenobarbus!<br />
Matricide! Incendiary!"<br />
</p><p>
Nero was alarmed. The people were absolute lords in the  <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
Circus. He wanted their favor on his side against the<br />
senate and the patricians, and especially after the burning<br />
of Rome he strove by all means to win it, and turn their<br />
anger against the Christians. He understood, besides,<br />
that to oppose longer was simply dangerous. A disturbance<span class="linenum">15</span><br />
begun in the Circus might seize the whole city, and have<br />
results incalculable. And seeing everywhere frowning brows,<br />
moved faces, and eyes fixed on him, he gave the sign for<br />
mercy.<br />

<h2>POLONIUS'S ADVICE TO HIS SON</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By William Shakespeare</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Memorize a goodly passage from this, and interpret
the meaning of your selection to the class.</p></div>


<div>
<span style="margin-left: 13em;">There; my blessing with thee!</span><br />
And these few precepts in thy memory<br />
See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,<br />
Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.<br />
Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.                 <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,<br />
Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;<br />
But do not dull thy palm with entertainment<br />
Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware<br />
Of entrance to a quarrel, but, being in,                 <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
Bear 't that the opposed may beware of thee.<br />
Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;<br />
Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.<br />
Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,<br />
But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;             <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
For the apparel oft proclaims the man,<br />
And they in France of the best rank and station<br />
Are most select and generous, chief in that.<br />
Neither a borrower nor a lender be;<br />
For loan oft loses both itself and friend,               <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.<br />
This above all; to thine own self be true,<br />
And it must follow, as the night the day,<br />
Thou canst not then be false to any man.<br />

<h2>MERCY</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By William Shakespeare</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Antonio, a merchant-shipper of Venice, has met with financial losses.
Shylock, his grasping creditor and competitor, demands in court the
fulfillment of Antonio's bond, which states that Antonio has forfeited a
pound of his own flesh to Shylock. Portia, a young woman who plays the
part of attorney for Antonio, makes the following appeal to Shylock for
mercy.</p></div>


<div>
The quality of mercy is not strain'd;<br />
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven<br />
Upon the place beneath. It is twice blest;<br />
It blesseth him that gives and him that takes.<br />
'Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes               <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
The throned monarch better than his crown;<br />
His scepter shows the force of temporal power,<br />
The attribute to awe and majesty,<br />
Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;<br />
But mercy is above this scepter'd sway;                  <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,<br />
It is an attribute to God himself;<br />
And earthly power doth then show likest God's<br />
When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,<br />
Though justice be thy plea, consider this,&mdash;             <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
That, in the course of justice, none of us<br />
Should see salvation; we do pray for mercy,<br />
And that same prayer doth teach us all to render<br />
The deeds of mercy.<br />
